We present several focused modifications of\nTransformer that greatly improve generalization capabilities on SCAN and select\none that remains on par with a vanilla Transformer on a standard machine\ntranslation (MT) task. Next, we study its performance in low-resource settings\nand on a newly introduced distribution-shifted English-French translation task.\nOverall, we find that improvements of a SCAN-capable model do not directly\ntransfer to the resource-rich MT setup. In contrast, in the low-resource setup,\ngeneral modifications lead to an improvement of up to 13.1% BLEU score w.r.t. a\nvanilla Transformer. Similarly, an improvement of 14% in an accuracy-based\nmetric is achieved in the introduced compositional English-French translation\ntask. This provides experimental evidence that the compositional generalization\nassessed in SCAN is particularly useful in resource-starved and domain-shifted\nscenarios.\n</p>","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":null,"pub_date":null,"source":null,"content":null,"extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chaabouni_R/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Rahma Chaabouni</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Dessi_R/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Roberto Dess&#xec;</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Kharitonov_E/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Eugene Kharitonov</a>"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]}},{"title":"Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Robust Pretrained Language Models.
