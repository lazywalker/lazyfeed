For\nthis purpose, we introduce ToM-Diary, a crowdsourced 18,238 diaries with 74,014\nKorean sentences annotated with different ToM levels. Each diary was annotated\nwith ToM levels by trained psychology students and reviewed by selected\npsychology experts. The annotators first divided the diaries based on whether\nthey mentioned other people: self-focused and other-focused. Examples of\nself-focused sentences are \"I am feeling good\". The other-focused sentences\nwere further classified into different levels. These levels differ by whether\nthe writer 1) mentions the presence of others without inferring their mental\nstate(e.g., I saw a man walking down the street), 2) fails to take the\nperspective of others (e.g., I don't understand why they refuse to wear masks),\nor 3) successfully takes the perspective of others (It must have been hard for\nthem to continue working).
