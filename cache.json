(arXiv:2109.06661v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06661","description":"<p>To advance the development of science and technology, research proposals are\nsubmitted to open-court competitive programs developed by government agencies\n(e.g., NSF). Proposal classification is one of the most important tasks to\nachieve effective and fair review assignments. Proposal classification aims to\nclassify a proposal into a length-variant sequence of labels. In this paper, we\nformulate the proposal classification problem into a hierarchical multi-label\nclassification task. Although there are certain prior studies, proposal\nclassification exhibit unique features: 1) the classification result of a\nproposal is in a hierarchical discipline structure with different levels of\ngranularity; 2) proposals contain multiple types of documents; 3) domain\nexperts can empirically provide partial labels that can be leveraged to improve\ntask performances. In this paper, we focus on developing a new deep proposal\nclassification framework to jointly model the three features. In particular, to\nsequentially generate labels, we leverage previously-generated labels to\npredict the label of next level; to integrate partial labels from experts, we\nuse the embedding of these empirical partial labels to initialize the state of\nneural networks. Our model can automatically identify the best length of label\nsequence to stop next label prediction. Finally, we present extensive results\nto demonstrate that our method can jointly model partial labels, textual\ninformation, and semantic dependencies in label sequences, and, thus, achieve\nadvanced performances.\n</p>","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":null,"pub_date":null,"source":null,"content":null,"extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Xiao_M/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Meng Xiao</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Qiao_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Ziyue Qiao</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Fu_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Yanjie Fu</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Du_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Yi Du</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wang_P/0/1/0/all/0/1\">Pengyang Wang</a>"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]}},{"title":"Sparse Fuzzy Attention for Structured Sentiment Analysis.
