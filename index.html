<summary class="article-expander__title">With One Voice: Composing a Travel Voice Assistant from Re-purposed Models. (arXiv:2108.11463v1 [eess.AS])</summary>

<span><p>Voice assistants provide users a new way of interacting with digital
products, allowing them to retrieve information and complete tasks with an
increased sense of control and flexibility. Such products are comprised of
several machine learning models, like Speech-to-Text transcription, Named
Entity Recognition and Resolution, and Text Classification. Building a voice
assistant from scratch takes the prolonged efforts of several teams
constructing numerous models and orchestrating between components. Alternatives
such as using third-party vendors or re-purposing existing models may be
considered to shorten time-to-market and development costs. However, each
option has its benefits and drawbacks. We present key insights from building a
voice search assistant for Booking.com search and recommendation system. Our
paper compares the achieved performance and development efforts in dedicated
tailor-made solutions against existing re-purposed models. We share and discuss
our data-driven decisions about implementation trade-offs and their estimated
outcomes in hindsight, showing that a fully functional machine learning product
can be built from existing models.

<span><p>Achieving human-level performance on some of Machine Reading Comprehension

ELECTRA in various aspects. We discover that {\em passage-to-question} and {\em
passage understanding} attentions are the most important ones, showing strong
correlations to the final performance than other parts. Through visualizations
and case studies, we also observe several general findings on the attention

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Program translation refers to migrating source code from one programming
language to another. It has a tremendous practical value in software
development as porting software across different languages is time-consuming
and costly. Automating program translation is of paramount importance in
software migration, and recently researchers explored unsupervised approaches
due to the unavailability of parallel corpora. However, the availability of
pre-trained language models for programming languages enable supervised
fine-tuning with a small amount of labeled examples. In this work, we present a
corpus of 8,475 programming problems and their solutions written in two popular
languages, Java and Python. We collect the dataset from competitive programming
sites, online platforms, and open source repositories. We present several
baselines, including models trained from scratch or pre-trained on large-scale
source code collection and fine-tuned on our proposed dataset. Experiment
results show that while the models perform relatively well in terms of the
lexical match, they lack in generating code that is accurate in terms of syntax
and data-flow match.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Reading order detection is the cornerstone to understanding visually-rich
documents (e.g., receipts and forms). Unfortunately, no existing work took
advantage of advanced deep learning models because it is too laborious to
annotate a large enough dataset. We observe that the reading order of WORD
documents is embedded in their XML metadata; meanwhile, it is easy to convert
WORD documents to PDFs or images. Therefore, in an automated manner, we
construct ReadingBank, a benchmark dataset that contains reading order, text,
and layout information for 500,000 document images covering a wide spectrum of
document types. This first-ever large-scale dataset unleashes the power of deep
neural networks for reading order detection. Specifically, our proposed
LayoutReader captures the text and layout information for reading order
prediction using the seq2seq model. It performs almost perfectly in reading
order detection and significantly improves both open-source and commercial OCR
engines in ordering text lines in their results in our experiments. We will
release the dataset and model at \url{https://aka.ms/readingbank}.

<span><p>Software developers write a lot of source code and documentation during

behavior, we propose a retrieval augmented framework, \tool, that retrieves
relevant code or summaries from a retrieval database and provides them as a
supplement to code generation or summarization models. \tool has a couple of
uniqueness. First, it extends the state-of-the-art dense retrieval technique to
search for relevant code or summaries. Second, it can work with retrieval
databases that include unimodal (only code or natural language description) or
bimodal instances (code-description pairs). We conduct experiments and
extensive analysis on two benchmark datasets of code generation and

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11607">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In many situations (e.g., distant supervision), unlabeled entity problem
seriously degrades the performances of named entity recognition (NER) models.
Recently, this issue has been well addressed by a notable approach based on
negative sampling. In this work, we perform two studies along this direction.
Firstly, we analyze why negative sampling succeeds both theoretically and
empirically. Based on the observation that named entities are highly sparse in
datasets, we show a theoretical guarantee that, for a long sentence, the
probability of containing no unlabeled entities in sampled negatives is high.
Missampling tests on synthetic datasets have verified our guarantee in
practice. Secondly, to mine hard negatives and further reduce missampling
rates, we propose a weighted and adaptive sampling distribution for negative
sampling. Experiments on synthetic datasets and well-annotated datasets show
that our method significantly improves negative sampling in robustness and
effectiveness. We also have achieved new state-of-the-art results on real-world
datasets.

<span><p>As the use of interactive machines grow, the task of Emotion Recognition in
Conversation (ERC) became more important. If the machine generated sentences

emotion recognition in conversation is inaccurate if the previous utterances
are not taken into account, many studies reflect the dialogue context to
improve the performances. We introduce CoMPM, a context embedding module (CoM)

<span><p>The massive growth of digital biomedical data is making biomedical text

<span><p>Theory-of-mind (ToM), a human ability to infer the intentions and thoughts of
others, is an essential part of empathetic experiences. We provide here the
framework for using NLP models to measure ToM expressed in written texts. For
this purpose, we introduce ToM-Diary, a crowdsourced 18,238 diaries with 74,014
Korean sentences annotated with different ToM levels. Each diary was annotated
with ToM levels by trained psychology students and reviewed by selected
psychology experts. The annotators first divided the diaries based on whether
they mentioned other people: self-focused and other-focused. Examples of
self-focused sentences are "I am feeling good". The other-focused sentences
were further classified into different levels. These levels differ by whether
the writer 1) mentions the presence of others without inferring their mental
state(e.g., I saw a man walking down the street), 2) fails to take the
perspective of others (e.g., I don't understand why they refuse to wear masks),
or 3) successfully takes the perspective of others (It must have been hard for
them to continue working). We tested whether state-of-the-art transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) could predict underlying ToM levels in sentences. We found
that BERT more successfully detected self-focused sentences than other-focused
ones. Sentences that successfully take the perspective of others (the highest
ToM level) were the most difficult to predict. Our study suggests a promising
direction for large-scale and computational approaches for identifying the
ability of authors to empathize and take the perspective of others. The dataset

bias problem. During the training stage, with teacher forcing these models are
optimized to maximize the likelihood of the gold summary given the gold summary

regular or seen names; name irregularity when often present for a certain

<span><p>Stylized image captioning systems aim to generate a caption not only
semantically related to a given image but also consistent with a given style
description. One of the biggest challenges with this task is the lack of
sufficient paired stylized data. Many studies focus on unsupervised approaches,
without considering from the perspective of data augmentation. We begin with
the observation that people may recall similar emotions when they are in
similar scenes, and often express similar emotions with similar style phrases,
which underpins our data augmentation idea. In this paper, we propose a novel
Extract-Retrieve-Generate data augmentation framework to extract style phrases
from small-scale stylized sentences and graft them to large-scale factual
captions. First, we design the emotional signal extractor to extract style
phrases from small-scale stylized sentences. Second, we construct the plugable
multi-modal scene retriever to retrieve scenes represented with pairs of an

in the large-scale factual data. In the end, based on the style phrases of
similar scenes and the factual description of the current scene, we build the
emotion-aware caption generator to generate fluent and diversified stylized
captions for the current scene. Extensive experimental results show that our
framework can alleviate the data scarcity problem effectively. It also
significantly boosts the performance of several existing image captioning

conflict mediation. This case study is the first to apply state-of-the-art
machine learning technologies to data from an ongoing mediation process. Using
dialogue transcripts from peace negotiations in Yemen, this study shows how
machine-learning tools can effectively support international mediators by
managing knowledge and offering additional conflict analysis tools to assess
complex information. Apart from illustrating the potential of machine learning
tools in conflict mediation, the paper also emphasises the importance of
interdisciplinary and participatory research design for the development of
context-sensitive and targeted tools and to ensure meaningful and responsible

<span><p>This paper presents a novel approach for the Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) task in continuous 3D environments, which requires an autonomous agent to
follow natural language instructions in unseen environments. Existing
end-to-end learning-based VLN methods struggle at this task as they focus
mostly on utilizing raw visual observations and lack the semantic
spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities which is crucial in generalizing to new
environments. In this regard, we present a hybrid transformer-recurrence model
which focuses on combining classical semantic mapping techniques with a
learning-based method. Our method creates a temporal semantic memory by
building a top-down local ego-centric semantic map and performs cross-modal
grounding to align map and language modalities to enable effective learning of
VLN policy. Empirical results in a photo-realistic long-horizon simulation
environment show that the proposed approach outperforms a variety of
state-of-the-art methods and baselines with over 22% relative improvement in

<span><p>Recent advances in text representation have shown that training on large
amounts of text is crucial for natural language understanding. However, models
trained without predefined notions of topical interest typically require
careful fine-tuning when transferred to specialized domains. When a sufficient
amount of within-domain text may not be available, expanding a seed corpus of
relevant documents from large-scale web data poses several challenges. First,
corpus expansion requires scoring and ranking each document in the collection,
an operation that can quickly become computationally expensive as the web
corpora size grows. Relying on dense vector spaces and pairwise similarity adds
to the computational expense. Secondly, as the domain concept becomes more
nuanced, capturing the long tail of domain-specific rare terms becomes
non-trivial, especially under limited seed corpora scenarios.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we consider the problem of fast approximate corpus expansion
given a small seed corpus with a few relevant documents as a query, with the
goal of capturing the long tail of a domain-specific set of concept terms. To
efficiently collect large-scale domain-specific corpora with limited relevance
feedback, we propose a novel truncated sparse document bit-vector
representation, termed Signature Assisted Unsupervised Corpus Expansion
(SAUCE). Experimental results show that SAUCE can reduce the computational
burden while ensuring high within-domain lexical coverage.

<span><p>Several metrics have been proposed for assessing the similarity of (abstract)
meaning representations (AMRs), but little is known about how they relate to
human similarity ratings. Moreover, the current metrics have complementary
strengths and weaknesses: some emphasize speed, while others make the alignment
of graph structures explicit, at the price of a costly alignment step.
</p>
<p>In this work we propose new Weisfeiler-Leman AMR similarity metrics that
unify the strengths of previous metrics, while mitigating their weaknesses.
Specifically, our new metrics are able to match contextualized substructures
and induce n:m alignments between their nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a
Benchmark for AMR Metrics based on Overt Objectives (BAMBOO), the first
benchmark to support empirical assessment of graph-based MR similarity metrics.
BAMBOO maximizes the interpretability of results by defining multiple overt
objectives that range from sentence similarity objectives to stress tests that
probe a metric's robustness against meaning-altering and meaning-preserving
graph transformations. We show the benefits of BAMBOO by profiling previous
metrics and our own metrics. Results indicate that our novel metrics may serve
as a strong baseline for future work.

learned visual features capture rich semantics (from free-form captions) and
accurate localization (from mouse traces), which are very effective when

supervised pre-training, LocTex can reduce the size of the pre-training dataset

the SUMBT+ and LaRL, fine-tuning the entire system, and then reinforcement
learning of dialog policy. We also introduce new reward criteria of
reinforcement learning for dialog policy training. Then, we discuss
experimental results depending on the reward criteria and different dialog

<span><p>The neural text generation suffers from the text degeneration issue such as
repetition. Traditional stochastic sampling methods only focus on truncating
the unreliable "tail" of the distribution, and do not address the "head" part,
which we show might contain tedious or even repetitive candidates with high
probability that lead to repetition loops. They also do not consider the issue
that human text does not always favor high-probability words. Inspired by
these, in this work we propose a heuristic sampling method. We propose to use
interquartile range of the predicted distribution to determine the "head" part,
then permutate and rescale the "head" with inverse probability. This aims at
decreasing the probability for the tedious and possibly repetitive candidates
with higher probability, and increasing the probability for the rational but
more surprising candidates with lower probability. The proposed algorithm
provides a reasonable permutation on the predicted distribution which enhances
diversity without compromising rationality of the distribution. We use

<span><p>Large pre-trained language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 have acquired a
surprising ability to perform zero-shot learning. For example, to classify
sentiment without any training examples, we can "prompt" the LM with the review
and the label description "Does the user like this movie?", and ask whether the
next word is "yes" or "no". However, the next word prediction training
objective is still misaligned with the target zero-shot learning objective. To
address this weakness, we propose meta-tuning, which directly optimizes the
zero-shot learning objective by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a
collection of datasets. We focus on classification tasks, and construct the
meta-dataset by aggregating 43 existing datasets and annotating 441 label
descriptions in a question-answering (QA) format. When evaluated on unseen
tasks, meta-tuned models outperform a same-sized QA model and the previous SOTA
zero-shot learning system based on natural language inference. Additionally,
increasing parameter count from 220M to 770M improves AUC-ROC scores by 6.3%,
and we forecast that even larger models would perform better. Therefore,
measuring zero-shot learning performance on language models out-of-the-box

<span><p>Transformers have become a standard architecture for many NLP problems. This
has motivated theoretically analyzing their capabilities as models of language,
in order to understand what makes them successful, and what their potential
weaknesses might be. Recent work has shown that transformers with hard
attention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by
constant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption,
which may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers.
In this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated
attention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the
attention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated
transformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With
some minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a
saturated transformer memory vector is $O(\log n)$, which implies saturated
transformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard
to saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer's
effective circuit depth by a factor of $O(\log n)$.
