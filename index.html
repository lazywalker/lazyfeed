<span><h3>Tabled 发布v0.3</h3>
<p>Tabled 是一个易于使用的库，用于美化 Rust 结构和枚举的输出。</p>
<p>Github<a href="https://github.com/zhiburt/tabled" rel="noopener noreferrer">链接</a>，https://github.com/zhiburt/tabled</p>
<h3>bma-benchmark 一个友好的基准测试工具</h3>
<p>使用 <code>bma_benchmark</code></p>
<pre><code>#[macro_use]
extern crate bma_benchmark;

use std::sync::Mutex;

let n = 100_000_000;
let mutex = Mutex::new(0);
benchmark_start!();
for _ in 0..n {
    let _a = mutex.lock().unwrap();
}
benchmark_print!(n);
</code></pre>
<p>使用宏 <code>benchmark!</code></p>
<pre><code>#[macro_use]
extern crate bma_benchmark;

use std::sync::Mutex;

let mutex = Mutex::new(0);
benchmark!(100_000_000, {
    let _a = mutex.lock().unwrap();
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bma-benchmark" rel="noopener noreferrer">链接</a>，https://crates.io/crates/bma-benchmark</p>
<h3>ferros</h3>
<p>seL4 是一个用于构建操作系统和嵌入式程序的工具包，这个开源项目是使 Rust 中的 seL4 编程变得更好。</p>
<p>以下代码演练假定使用示例 sel4_start 库执行 selfe，并介绍了 ferros 的某些方面。</p>
<pre><code>use selfe_sys;
use ferros::alloc::{self, micro_alloc, smart_alloc};
use ferros::userland::{root_cnode, BootInfo};

// The raw boot info is provided by the sel4_start library
let raw_boot_info: &amp;'static selfe_sys::seL4_BootInfo = unsafe { &amp;*sel4_start::BOOTINFO };


// Utility for finding and claiming `Untyped` instances supplied by the boot info.
let mut allocator = micro_alloc::Allocator::bootstrap(&amp;raw_boot_info)?;
let initial_untyped = allocator
    .get_untyped::&lt;U20&gt;() // The size of the Untyped instance, as bits
    .expect("Couldn't find an untyped instance of the desired size");

// Create the top-level CNode wrapper with type-level-tracked remaining slot capacity
let (root_cnode, local_slots) = root_cnode(&amp;raw_boot_info);

// Once we have an initial Untyped instance, memory distribution from it
// can be tracked with compile-time checks. The smart_alloc macro synthesizes
// the allocation code, and the capacity bounds are statically verified by
// the type checker. The effect is that you can write 'slots' in the macro body 
// anywhere you need some slots, and you'll get the right number allocated
// with type inference. A reference to 'ut' does the same for untyped memory. 
smart_alloc!(|slots from local_slots, ut from uts| {

    // Create a page table seL4 kernel object and return a capability pointer to it.
    // Here we use a variable binding type annotation and Rust's type system can figure out
    // if it can allocate a large enough Untyped instance and enough cnode slots
    // to represent this particular kernel object.
    let example_page_table: LocalCap&lt;UnmappedPageTable&gt; = retype(ut, slots)?;

    // Create a resource-tracking wrapper around the raw boot info to assist in
    // virtual memory related operations.
    let boot_info  = BootInfo::wrap(raw_boot_info, ut, slots);
    let (root_page_table, boot_info) = boot_info.map_page_table(root_page_table)?;
});

<summary class="article-expander__title">【Rust日报】2021-09-10 Rust 1.55 稳定版发布</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://rustcc.cn/article?id=c36da117-d84e-42a0-9304-b02fe6f27df1">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><h1>Rust 1.55 稳定版发布</h1>
<p>Rust 1.55 是 2021 Edition 正式发布之前的倒数第二个版本，此版本主要更新如下：</p>
<ul>
<li>range 操作符支持半开语法</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>match x as u32 {
      0 =&gt; println!("zero!"),
      1.. =&gt; println!("positive number!"),
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>极大的提高浮点数的解析速度</li>
</ul>
<p>采用新的 Eisel-Lemire 算法解析浮点数，不仅在速度上有很大提升，之前一些解析失败的边缘 case 也全都修复了</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cargo 构建的时候不再重复报 Error</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>细化 io::ErrorKind</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>使用 ErrorKind::Other 来区分标准库之外产生的 io Error，标准库之内不会再产生 ErrorKind::Other 的 Error。标准库未来暂未分类的 Error 类型，统一使用 Uncategorized。</p>
<ul>
<li>数组增加 map() 方法</li>
</ul>
<p>数组的 map() 方法返回的依然是数组，对数组来说更方便！</p>
<ul>
<li>稳定 ops::ControlFlow</li>
</ul>
<p>这是未来要稳定的 <code>try trait v2</code> 的一部分。</p>
<pre><code>pub enum ControlFlow&lt;B, C = ()&gt; {
    Continue(C),
    Break(B),
}
</code></pre>
<p>标准库里面很多地方都用到了这个类型，很有用。</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo clippy --fix</code> 可以自动帮你修复 clippy 的警告</li>
</ul>
<p>这个非常赞！</p>

<h1>纪念 Anna Harren</h1>
<p>Anna Harren 是第一个将 Rust 的 ::&lt;&gt; 语法命名为 Turbofish 的人。</p>
<p>Rust 官方发布 1.55 的时候在博客里还特意纪念了最近刚去世的 Anna Harren。</p>

<h1>Rustaceans 准则</h1>
<p>Niko 发布了一篇博客，总结出 Rustaceans 的准则，比如其中提到：</p>
<p><strong>Rust empowers by being…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>⚙️ Reliable: “if it compiles, it works”</li>
<li>🐎 Performant: “idiomatic code runs efficiently”</li>
<li>🥰 Supportive: “the language, tools, and community are here to help”</li>
<li>🧩 Productive: “a little effort does a lot of work”</li>
<li>🔧 Transparent: “you can predict and control low-level details”</li>
<li>🤸 Versatile: “you can do anything with Rust”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Rustacean</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>💖 Be kind and considerate</li>
<li>✨ Bring joy to the user</li>
<li>👋 Show up</li>
<li>🔭 Recognize others’ knowledge</li>
<li>🔁 Start somewhere</li>
<li>✅ Follow through</li>
<li>🤝 Pay it forward</li>
<li>🎁 Trust and delegate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>课程时间：</strong> 2021年8月15日 20:30-21:30</p>
<p><strong>课程介绍：</strong></p>
<p>如果想用 Rust 开发大型目，或者学习大型项目代码，特别是框架级别的项目，那么 Rust 的宏机制肯定是一个必须掌握的技能。 例如 datafuse 中的一些配置管理：
<img src="https://datafuse-1255499614.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/pbc/3/rust-macro-1628478411126.jpg" alt></p>
<p>这就是通过宏实现配置的统一行为，代码参考：
https://github.com/datafuselabs/datafuse/blob/master/fusequery/query/src/sessions/settings.rs#L19</p>
<p>https://github.com/datafuselabs/datafuse/blob/master/fusequery/query/src/sessions/macros.rs</p>
<p>Rust 语言强大的一个特点就是可以创建和利用宏，不过创建宏看起来挺复杂，常常令刚接触 Rust 的开发者生畏惧。 在本次公开课中帮助你理解 Rust Macro 的基本原理，学习如何创自已的 Rust 宏，以及查看源码学习宏的实现。</p>
<h3>课程大纲</h3>
<ul>
<li>什么是 Rust 宏</li>
<li>什么是宏运行原理</li>
<li>如何创建 Rust 宏过程</li>
<li>阅读 datafuse 项目源码， 学习项目中宏的实现</li>

<span><p>We study Comparative Preference Classification (CPC) which aims at predicting
whether a preference comparison exists between two entities in a given sentence
and, if so, which entity is preferred over the other. High-quality CPC models
can significantly benefit applications such as comparative question answering
and review-based recommendations. Among the existing approaches, non-deep
learning methods suffer from inferior performances. The state-of-the-art graph
neural network-based ED-GAT (Ma et al., 2020) only considers syntactic
information while ignoring the critical semantic relations and the sentiments
to the compared entities. We proposed sentiment Analysis Enhanced COmparative
Network (SAECON) which improves CPC ac-curacy with a sentiment analyzer that
learns sentiments to individual entities via domain adaptive knowledge
transfer. Experiments on the CompSent-19 (Panchenko et al., 2019) dataset
present a significant improvement on the F1 scores over the best existing CPC
approaches.

<span><p>Cyber intelligence is widely and abundantly available in numerous open online
sources with reports on vulnerabilities and incidents. This constant stream of
noisy information requires new tools and techniques if it is to be used for the
benefit of analysts and investigators in various organizations. In this paper
we present and implement a novel knowledge graph and knowledge mining framework
for extracting relevant information from free-form text about incidents in the
cyber domain. Our framework includes a machine learning based pipeline as well
as crawling methods for generating graphs of entities, attackers and the
related information with our non-technical cyber ontology. We test our
framework on publicly available cyber incident datasets to evaluate the
accuracy of our knowledge mining methods as well as the usefulness of the
framework in the use of cyber analysts. Our results show analyzing the
knowledge graph constructed using the novel framework, an analyst can infer
additional information from the current cyber landscape in terms of risk to
various entities and the propagation of risk between industries and countries.
Expanding the framework to accommodate more technical and operational level
information can increase the accuracy and explainability of trends and risk in

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03853">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pimentel et al. (2020) recently analysed probing from an
information-theoretic perspective. They argue that probing should be seen as
approximating a mutual information. This led to the rather unintuitive
conclusion that representations encode exactly the same information about a
target task as the original sentences. The mutual information, however, assumes
the true probability distribution of a pair of random variables is known,
leading to unintuitive results in settings where it is not. This paper proposes
a new framework to measure what we term Bayesian mutual information, which
analyses information from the perspective of Bayesian agents -- allowing for
more intuitive findings in scenarios with finite data. For instance, under
Bayesian MI we have that data can add information, processing can help, and
information can hurt, which makes it more intuitive for machine learning
applications. Finally, we apply our framework to probing where we believe
Bayesian mutual information naturally operationalises ease of extraction by
explicitly limiting the available background knowledge to solve a task.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03858">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent works have found evidence of gender bias in models of machine
translation and coreference resolution using mostly synthetic diagnostic
datasets. While these quantify bias in a controlled experiment, they often do
so on a small scale and consist mostly of artificial, out-of-distribution
sentences. In this work, we find grammatical patterns indicating stereotypical
and non-stereotypical gender-role assignments (e.g., female nurses versus male
dancers) in corpora from three domains, resulting in a first large-scale gender
bias dataset of 108K diverse real-world English sentences. We manually verify
the quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various
coreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested
models tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural
inputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems.
Finally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference
resolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set. Our dataset and
models are publicly available at www.github.com/SLAB-NLP/BUG. We hope they will
spur future research into gender bias evaluation mitigation techniques in
realistic settings.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03888">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of
NLP tasks including summarization. Training and inference using large
transformer models can be computationally expensive. Previous work has focused
on one important bottleneck, the quadratic self-attention mechanism in the
encoder. Modified encoder architectures such as LED or LoBART use local
attention patterns to address this problem for summarization. In contrast, this
work focuses on the transformer's encoder-decoder attention mechanism. The cost
of this attention becomes more significant in inference or training approaches
that require model-generated histories. First, we examine the complexity of the
encoder-decoder attention. We demonstrate empirically that there is a sparse
sentence structure in document summarization that can be exploited by
constraining the attention mechanism to a subset of input sentences, whilst
maintaining system performance. Second, we propose a modified architecture that
selects the subset of sentences to constrain the encoder-decoder attention.
Experiments are carried out on abstractive summarization tasks, including
CNN/DailyMail, XSum, Spotify Podcast, and arXiv.

<span><p>We introduce ELIT, the Emory Language and Information Toolkit, which is a
comprehensive NLP framework providing transformer-based end-to-end models for
core tasks with a special focus on memory efficiency while maintaining
state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. Compared to existing toolkits, ELIT
features an efficient Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model with many downstream
tasks that include lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity
recognition, dependency parsing, constituency parsing, semantic role labeling,
and AMR parsing. The backbone of ELIT's MTL framework is a pre-trained
transformer encoder that is shared across tasks to speed up their inference.
ELIT provides pre-trained models developed on a remix of eight datasets. To
scale up its service, ELIT also integrates a RESTful Client/Server combination.
On the server side, ELIT extends its functionality to cover other tasks such as
tokenization and coreference resolution, providing an end user with agile

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Representation of linguistic phenomena in computational language models is
typically assessed against the predictions of existing linguistic theories of
these phenomena. Using the notion of polarity as a case study, we show that
this is not always the most adequate set-up. We probe polarity via so-called
'negative polarity items' (in particular, English 'any') in two pre-trained
Transformer-based models (BERT and GPT-2). We show that -- at least for
polarity -- metrics derived from language models are more consistent with data
from psycholinguistic experiments than linguistic theory predictions.
Establishing this allows us to more adequately evaluate the performance of
language models and also to use language models to discover new insights into
natural language grammar beyond existing linguistic theories. Overall, our
results encourage a closer tie between experiments with human subjects and with
language models. We propose methods to enable this closer tie, with language
models as part of experimental pipeline, and show this pipeline at work.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>While recent research on natural language inference has considerably
benefited from large annotated datasets, the amount of inference-related
knowledge (including commonsense) provided in the annotated data is still
rather limited. There have been two lines of approaches that can be used to
further address the limitation: (1) unsupervised pretraining can leverage
knowledge in much larger unstructured text data; (2) structured (often
human-curated) knowledge has started to be considered in neural-network-based
models for NLI. An immediate question is whether these two approaches
complement each other, or how to develop models that can bring together their
advantages. In this paper, we propose models that leverage structured knowledge
in different components of pre-trained models. Our results show that the

consists of a conformer [1] encoder and two parallel transformer decoders. We
use a phoneme decoder (PHN-DEC) for the phoneme recognition task and a grapheme
decoder (GRP-DEC) to predict grapheme sequence. We consider the phoneme
recognition task as an auxiliary task for our multi-task learning framework. We
jointly optimize the network for both phoneme and grapheme recognition tasks
using Joint CTC-Attention [2] training. We use a conditional decoding scheme to
inject the language information into the model before predicting the grapheme

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Currently, multilingual machine translation is receiving more and more
attention since it brings better performance for low resource languages (LRLs)
and saves more space. However, existing multilingual machine translation models
face a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of
different languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We
argue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning
competencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the
learning competencies of different languages and propose Competence-based
Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation, named CCL-M.
Specifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high
resource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) Self-evaluated
Competence, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2)
HRLs-evaluated Competence, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned
according to HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence. Based on the above competencies,
we utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the
training set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel
competenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting
training samples in multilingual training. Experimental results show that our
approach has achieved a steady and significant performance gain compared to the

<span><p>Multi-party multi-turn dialogue comprehension brings unprecedented challenges
on handling the complicated scenarios from multiple speakers and criss-crossed
discourse relationship among speaker-aware utterances. Most existing methods
deal with dialogue contexts as plain texts and pay insufficient attention to
the crucial speaker-aware clues. In this work, we propose an enhanced
speaker-aware model with masking attention and heterogeneous graph networks to
comprehensively capture discourse clues from both sides of speaker property and
speaker-aware relationships. With such comprehensive speaker-aware modeling,
experimental results show that our speaker-aware model helps achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark dataset Molweni. Case analysis
shows that our model enhances the connections between utterances and their own
speakers and captures the speaker-aware discourse relations, which are critical
for dialogue modeling.

<span><p>With the rapid increase in the volume of dialogue data from daily life, there
is a growing demand for dialogue summarization. Unfortunately, training a large
summarization model is generally infeasible due to the inadequacy of dialogue
data with annotated summaries. Most existing works for low-resource dialogue
summarization directly pretrain models in other domains, e.g., the news domain,
but they generally neglect the huge difference between dialogues and
conventional articles. To bridge the gap between out-of-domain pretraining and
in-domain fine-tuning, in this work, we propose a multi-source pretraining
paradigm to better leverage the external summary data. Specifically, we exploit
large-scale in-domain non-summary data to separately pretrain the dialogue
encoder and the summary decoder. The combined encoder-decoder model is then
pretrained on the out-of-domain summary data using adversarial critics, aiming
to facilitate domain-agnostic summarization. The experimental results on two
public datasets show that with only limited training data, our approach
achieves competitive performance and generalizes well in different dialogue
scenarios.

To summarize more accurately and similar to human writing patterns, we applied

the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult that faces two main
challenges: (1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future
timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen
entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the
first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent

<span><p>The goal of building intelligent dialogue systems has largely been
\textit{separately} pursued under two paradigms: task-oriented dialogue (TOD)
systems, which perform goal-oriented functions, and open-domain dialogue (ODD)
systems, which focus on non-goal-oriented chitchat. The two dialogue modes can
potentially be intertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as
easily done by a friendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in
conversational agents, as the integration makes them more accessible and
useful. Our paper addresses this problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn
dialogues. Based on the popular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset
FusedChat, by rewriting the existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This
procedure constructs conversation sessions containing exchanges from both
dialogue modes. It features inter-mode contextual dependency, i.e., the
dialogue turns from the two modes depend on each other. Rich dependency
patterns including co-reference and ellipsis are features. The new dataset,
with 60k new human-written ODD turns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a
benchmark to test a dialogue model's ability to perform inter-mode
conversations. This is a more challenging task since the model has to determine
the appropriate dialogue mode and generate the response based on the inter-mode
context. But such models would better mimic human-level conversation
capabilities. We evaluate baseline models on this task, including
\textit{classification-based} two-stage models and \textit{two-in-one} fused

classification tasks still suffer from a common pitfall of adopting inference
heuristics based on lexical overlap, e.g., models incorrectly assuming a
sentence pair is of the same meaning because they consist of the same set of
words. Interestingly, we find that this particular inference heuristic is
significantly less present in the zero-shot evaluation of the prompt-based
model, indicating how finetuning can be destructive to useful knowledge learned

To alleviate this problem, we introduce a simple smoothing strategy upon the
InfoNCE loss function, termedGaussian Smoothing InfoNCE
(GS-InfoNCE).Specifically, we add random Gaussian noise vectors as negative
samples, which act asa smoothing of the negative sample space.Though being
simple, the proposed smooth-ing strategy brings substantial improvements to
unsup-SimCSE. We evaluate GS-InfoNCEon the standard semantic text similarity
(STS)task. GS-InfoNCE outperforms the state-of-the-art unsup-SimCSE by an
average Spear-man correlation of 1.38%, 0.72%, 1.17% and0.28% on the base of
BERT-base, BERT-large,RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large, respectively.

<span><p>Opinion summarization has been traditionally approached with unsupervised,
weakly-supervised and few-shot learning techniques. In this work, we collect a
large dataset of summaries paired with user reviews for over 31,000 products,
enabling supervised training. However, the number of reviews per product is
large (320 on average), making summarization - and especially training a
summarizer - impractical. Moreover, the content of many reviews is not
reflected in the human-written summaries, and, thus, the summarizer trained on
random review subsets hallucinates. In order to deal with both of these
challenges, we formulate the task as jointly learning to select informative
subsets of reviews and summarizing the opinions expressed in these subsets. The
choice of the review subset is treated as a latent variable, predicted by a
small and simple selector. The subset is then fed into a more powerful
summarizer. For joint training, we use amortized variational inference and
policy gradient methods. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of
selecting informative reviews resulting in improved quality of summaries and
reduced hallucinations.

<span><p>Prompts for pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable
performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various
downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and
only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for
adapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to
be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning
performs comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream
data are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning
settings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning in practice. We
attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts.
Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts
into the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this
Pre-trained Prompt Tuning framework "PPT". To ensure the generalization of PPT,
we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and
pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that
tuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform
full-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings. Our approach
is effective and efficient for using large-scale PLMs in practice.

<span><p>The ability to identify and resolve uncertainty is crucial for the robustness
of a dialogue system. Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems
that utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such
systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more
complex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take
uncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions
and less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often
evaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream
policy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in
neural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of
policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to
the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with
a user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating
these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the

<span><p>Recently, the textual adversarial attack models become increasingly popular
due to their successful in estimating the robustness of NLP models. However,
existing works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a
single granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or
sentence-level), which is insufficient to explore the holistic textual space
for generation; (2) They need to query victim models hundreds of times to make
a successful attack, which is highly inefficient in practice. To address such
problems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to
effectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to
victim models. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement-learning based method to
train a multi-granularity attack agent through behavior cloning with the expert
knowledge from our MAYA algorithm to further reduce the query times.
Additionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only
output labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments
to evaluate our attack models by attacking BiLSTM, BERT and RoBERTa in two
different black-box attack settings and three benchmark datasets. Experimental
results show that our models achieve overall better attacking performance and
produce more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples compared to baseline

<span><p>Contrastive learning has been attracting much attention for learning
unsupervised sentence embeddings. The current state-of-the-art unsupervised
method is the unsupervised SimCSE (unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE takes dropout as
a minimal data augmentation method, and passes the same input sentence to a
pre-trained Transformer encoder (with dropout turned on) twice to obtain the
two corresponding embeddings to build a positive pair. As the length
information of a sentence will generally be encoded into the sentence
embeddings due to the usage of position embedding in Transformer, each positive
pair in unsup-SimCSE actually contains the same length information. And thus
unsup-SimCSE trained with these positive pairs is probably biased, which would
tend to consider that sentences of the same or similar length are more similar
in semantics. Through statistical observations, we find that unsup-SimCSE does
have such a problem. To alleviate it, we apply a simple repetition operation to
modify the input sentence, and then pass the input sentence and its modified
counterpart to the pre-trained Transformer encoder, respectively, to get the
positive pair. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the community of computer
vision and introduce a momentum contrast, enlarging the number of negative
pairs without additional calculations. The proposed two modifications are
applied on positive and negative pairs separately, and build a new sentence
embedding method, termed Enhanced Unsup-SimCSE (ESimCSE). We evaluate the

the question of whether valid attacks are actually feasible. In this work, we
investigate this through the lens of human language ability. We report on
crowdsourcing studies in which we task humans with iteratively modifying words
in an input text, while receiving immediate model feedback, with the aim of
causing a sentiment classification model to misclassify the example. Our
findings suggest that humans are capable of generating a substantial amount of
adversarial examples using semantics-preserving word substitutions. We analyze
how human-generated adversarial examples compare to the recently proposed

<span><p>In cross-lingual text classification, it is required that task-specific
training data in high-resource source languages are available, where the task
is identical to that of a low-resource target language. However, collecting
such training data can be infeasible because of the labeling cost, task
characteristics, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes an alternative
solution that uses only task-independent word embeddings of high-resource
languages and bilingual dictionaries. First, we construct a dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the
possibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The
remaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are
considered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the
heterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and
language-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.
Furthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many
incorrect translations. Its robustness allows the usage of a wider range of
dictionaries such as an automatically constructed dictionary and crowdsourced
dictionary, which are convenient for real-world applications.

a small number of rogue dimensions, often just 1-3, dominate these measures.
Moreover, we find a striking mismatch between the dimensions that dominate
similarity measures and those which are important to the behavior of the model.
We show that simple postprocessing techniques such as standardization are able

framework based on non-autoregressive (NAR) models. End-to-end speech
translation models have several advantages over traditional cascade systems
such as inference latency reduction. However, conventional AR decoding methods
are not fast enough because each token is generated incrementally. NAR models,
however, can accelerate the decoding speed by generating multiple tokens in
parallel on the basis of the token-wise conditional independence assumption. We
propose a unified NAR E2E-ST framework called Orthros, which has an NAR decoder
and an auxiliary shallow AR decoder on top of the shared encoder. The auxiliary
shallow AR decoder selects the best hypothesis by rescoring multiple candidates
generated from the NAR decoder in parallel (parallel AR rescoring). We adopt
conditional masked language model (CMLM) and a connectionist temporal
classification (CTC)-based model as NAR decoders for Orthros, referred to as
Orthros-CMLM and Orthros-CTC, respectively. We also propose two training
methods to enhance the CMLM decoder. Experimental evaluations on three
benchmark datasets with six language directions demonstrated that Orthros
achieved large improvements in translation quality with a very small overhead
compared with the baseline NAR model. Moreover, the Conformer encoder
architecture enabled large quality improvements, especially for CTC-based

3.63x on CPU with translation quality comparable to that of an AR model.

predicting whether a source token needs to be translated or transliterated to
the target language, which is common in cross-script translation tasks (i.e.,
where source and target do not share the written script). For such cases, we

performance. Using the CoNLL-2012 and PreCo datasets, we dissect the best
instantiation of the mainstream end-to-end coreference resolution model that
underlies most current best-performing coreference systems, and empirically
analyze the behavior of its two components: mention detector and mention
linker. While the detector traditionally focuses heavily on recall as a design
decision, we demonstrate the importance of precision, calling for their

its errors mainly involve pronoun resolution. We propose promising next steps

<span><p>A key challenge in training neural networks for a given medical imaging task
is often the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of manually labeled
examples. In contrast, textual imaging reports, which are often readily
available in medical records, contain rich but unstructured interpretations
written by experts as part of standard clinical practice. We propose using
these textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image
interpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional
manually labeled examples. We use an image-text matching task to train a
feature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a
supervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural
network that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports
during inference. This approach can be applied to any task for which text-image

<span><p>There is an increasing interest in the use of mathematical word problem (MWP)
generation in educational assessment. Different from standard natural question
generation, MWP generation needs to maintain the underlying mathematical
operations between quantities and variables, while at the same time ensuring
the relevance between the output and the given topic. To address above problem,
we develop an end-to-end neural model to generate diverse MWPs in real-world
scenarios from commonsense knowledge graph and equations. The proposed model
(1) learns both representations from edge-enhanced Levi graphs of symbolic
equations and commonsense knowledge; (2) automatically fuses equation and
commonsense knowledge information via a self-planning module when generating
the MWPs. Experiments on an educational gold-standard set and a large-scale

Motivated by traditional semantic parsing where compositionality is explicitly
accounted for by symbolic grammars, we propose a new decoding framework that
preserves the expressivity and generality of sequence-to-sequence models while
featuring lexicon-style alignments and disentangled information processing.
Specifically, we decompose decoding into two phases where an input utterance is
first tagged with semantic symbols representing the meaning of individual
words, and then a sequence-to-sequence model is used to predict the final
meaning representation conditioning on the utterance and the predicted tag

pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the

As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good
performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to
such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding:
pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their
undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to
this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a
decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired
behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic

The retrieval model is typically trained to maximize the likelihood of the

evidence candidates. Moreover, not all such candidates are labeled as positive
during annotation, rendering the training signal weak and noisy. This problem
is exacerbated when the questions are unanswerable or when the answers are

Reordering a narrative can impact the temporal, causal, event-based, and other

its interpretation and interestingness. In this paper, we propose and

method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix 'bugs' or
unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or

In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to

KnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and
knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and
ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method,
changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a
consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this

<span><p>Multimodal pre-training with text, layout, and image has achieved SOTA
performance for visually-rich document understanding tasks recently, which
demonstrates the great potential for joint learning across different
modalities. In this paper, we present LayoutXLM, a multimodal pre-trained model
for multilingual document understanding, which aims to bridge the language
barriers for visually-rich document understanding. To accurately evaluate
LayoutXLM, we also introduce a multilingual form understanding benchmark
dataset named XFUND, which includes form understanding samples in 7 languages
(Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese), and
key-value pairs are manually labeled for each language. Experiment results show
that the LayoutXLM model has significantly outperformed the existing SOTA
cross-lingual pre-trained models on the XFUND dataset. The pre-trained
LayoutXLM model and the XFUND dataset are publicly available at

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07843">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised learning framework for
end-to-end speech separation. The proposed method first uses mixtures of
unseparated sources and the mixture invariant training (MixIT) criterion to
train a teacher model. The teacher model then estimates separated sources that
are used to train a student model with standard permutation invariant training
(PIT). The student model can be fine-tuned with supervised data, i.e., paired
artificial mixtures and clean speech sources, and further improved via model
distillation. Experiments with single and multi channel mixtures show that the
teacher-student training resolves the over-separation problem observed in the
original MixIT method. Further, the semisupervised performance is comparable to
a fully-supervised separation system trained using ten times the amount of
supervised data.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In this work, we present to the NLP community, and to the wider research
community as a whole, an application for the diachronic analysis of research

researchers to track research trends and development over the years. The
analysis methods are collated from well-cited research works, with a few of our
own methods added for good measure. Succinctly put, some of the analysis
methods are: keyword extraction, word clouds, predicting
declining/stagnant/growing trends using Productivity, tracking bi-grams using
Acceleration plots, finding the Semantic Drift of words, tracking trends using
similarity, etc. To demonstrate the utility and efficacy of our tool, we
perform a case study on the cs.CL corpus of the arXiv repository and draw
inferences from the analysis methods. The toolkit and the associated code are

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04556">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Code representation learning, which aims to encode the semantics of source
code into distributed vectors, plays an important role in recent
deep-learning-based models for code intelligence. Recently, many pre-trained
language models for source code (e.g., CuBERT and CodeBERT) have been proposed
to model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code
intelligence tasks such as code search, code clone detection, and program
translation. Current approaches typically consider the source code as a plain
sequence of tokens, or inject the structure information (e.g., AST and
data-flow) into the sequential model pre-training. To further explore the
properties of programming languages, this paper proposes SynCoBERT, a
syntax-guided multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach for better code
representations. Specially, we design two novel pre-training objectives
originating from the symbolic and syntactic properties of source code, i.e.,
Identifier Prediction (IP) and AST Edge Prediction (TEP), which are designed to
predict identifiers, and edges between two nodes of AST, respectively.
Meanwhile, to exploit the complementary information in semantically equivalent
modalities (i.e., code, comment, AST) of the code, we propose a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to maximize the mutual information among
different modalities. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks related to
code intelligence show that SynCoBERT advances the state-of-the-art with the
same pre-training corpus and model size.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12202">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those
that come first. Or they encode entity features and relation features in a
parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work has claimed, our auxiliary experiments suggest that
relation prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a
non-negligible way. The source code can be found at

Wasserstein distance and barycenter. By modelling the layer output of deep
contextualized embeddings as a probability distribution rather than by a vector
embedding; this framework provides a natural way to aggregate the different
outputs through the Wasserstein space topology. In addition, it provides
theoretical grounds to our metric and offers an alternative to available
solutions e.g., MoverScore and BertScore). Numerical evaluation is performed on
four different tasks: machine translation, summarization, data2text generation

<span><p>Spoken dialog systems need to be able to handle both multiple languages and

In this work, we introduce new pretraining losses tailored to learn
multilingual spoken dialog representations. The goal of these losses is to
expose the model to code-switched language. To scale up training, we
automatically build a pretraining corpus composed of multilingual conversations
in five different languages (French, Italian, English, German and Spanish) from
\texttt{OpenSubtitles}, a huge multilingual corpus composed of 24.3G tokens. We
test the generic representations on \texttt{MIAM}, a new benchmark composed of
five dialog act corpora on the same aforementioned languages as well as on two
novel multilingual downstream tasks (\textit{i.e} multilingual mask utterance
retrieval and multilingual inconsistency identification). Our experiments show
that our new code switched-inspired losses achieve a better performance in both
monolingual and multilingual settings.

<span><p>Extractive text summarization aims at extracting the most representative
sentences from a given document as its summary. To extract a good summary from
a long text document, sentence embedding plays an important role. Recent
studies have leveraged graph neural networks to capture the inter-sentential
relationship (e.g., the discourse graph) to learn contextual sentence
embedding. However, those approaches neither consider multiple types of
inter-sentential relationships (e.g., semantic similarity &amp; natural
connection), nor model intra-sentential relationships (e.g, semantic &amp;
syntactic relationship among words). To address these problems, we propose a
novel Multiplex Graph Convolutional Network (Multi-GCN) to jointly model
different types of relationships among sentences and words. Based on Multi-GCN,
we propose a Multiplex Graph Summarization (Multi-GraS) model for extractive
text summarization. Finally, we evaluate the proposed models on the
CNN/DailyMail benchmark dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Most existing NER methods rely on extensive labeled data for model training,
which struggles in the low-resource scenarios with limited training data.
Recently, prompt-tuning methods for pre-trained language models have achieved
remarkable performance in few-shot learning by exploiting prompts as task
guidance to reduce the gap between training progress and downstream tuning.
Inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel lightweight generative
framework with prompt-guided attention for low-resource NER (LightNER).
Specifically, we construct the semantic-aware answer space of entity categories
for prompt learning to generate the entity span sequence and entity categories
without any label-specific classifiers. We further propose prompt-guided
attention by incorporating continuous prompts into the self-attention layer to
re-modulate the attention and adapt pre-trained weights. Note that we only tune
those continuous prompts with the whole parameter of the pre-trained language
model fixed, thus, making our approach lightweight and flexible for
low-resource scenarios and can better transfer knowledge across domains.
Experimental results show that LightNER can obtain comparable performance in
the standard supervised setting and outperform strong baselines in low-resource
settings by tuning only a small part of the parameters.

<span><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis is a trending area of research, and the
multimodal fusion is one of its most active topic. Acknowledging humans
communicate through a variety of channels (i.e visual, acoustic, linguistic),
multimodal systems aim at integrating different unimodal representations into a
synthetic one. So far, a consequent effort has been made on developing complex
architectures allowing the fusion of these modalities. However, such systems
are mainly trained by minimising simple losses such as $L_1$ or cross-entropy.
In this work, we investigate unexplored penalties and propose a set of new
objectives that measure the dependency between modalities. We demonstrate that
our new penalties lead to a consistent improvement (up to $4.3$ on accuracy)
across a large variety of state-of-the-art models on two well-known sentiment
analysis datasets: \texttt{CMU-MOSI} and \texttt{CMU-MOSEI}. Our method not
only achieves a new SOTA on both datasets but also produces representations
that are more robust to modality drops. Finally, a by-product of our methods
includes a statistical network which can be used to interpret the high
dimensional representations learnt by the model.

a new approach to studying idiolects through a massive cross-author comparison

analogy-based probing task, showing that the learned representations exhibit
surprising regularities that encode qualitative and quantitative shifts of

explore this impact on the syntactic capabilities of RoBERTa, using models
trained on incremental sizes of raw text data. First, we use syntactic
structural probes to determine whether models pretrained on more data encode a
higher amount of syntactic information. Second, we perform a targeted syntactic
evaluation to analyze the impact of pretraining data size on the syntactic
generalization performance of the models. Third, we compare the performance of
the different models on three downstream applications: part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing and paraphrase identification. We complement our study with
an analysis of the cost-benefit trade-off of training such models. Our
