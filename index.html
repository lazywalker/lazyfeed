<span><h3>Rust 的 Logging 推荐</h3>
<p>内容整理自 Reddit 的讨论：<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/pmdh6a/what_is_the_current_recommendation_for_logging_in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the current recommendation for logging in Rust? : rust</a>。</p>
<p>问题简述：除了标准的 <code>log</code>，还有不少选择：<code>env_logger</code>，<code>tracing</code>，<code>slog</code>，<code>simplelog</code> 等等，最佳实践是什么？</p>
<p>来自 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Koxiaet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koxiaet</a> 的答复：通常有两类与日志相关的 crate：日志接口和日志消费者。接口提供了想要记录某些东西时调用的函数，消费者处理将结构化日志数据格式化到某个地方（stderr 或文件）。两个主要的接口是 <code>log</code> 和 <code>tracing</code>，后者功能更强大因为它支持结构化日志记录，但前者更普遍。还有另一个结构化日志接口 slog，比 <code>tracing</code> 更古老但用的较少。每个日志接口都有自己生态系统，可以根据自己的需要选择。如果在写一个库，<code>log</code> 是个不错的选择，因为所有的日志记录接口都与它兼容。但如果你确实需要结构化日志记录，则可以改用 <code>tracing</code>，这取决于你的需求，比如你是需要写到文件还是只是终端。</p>

<h3>Rust 全栈</h3>
<p>本文是一篇博客翻译，来自：<a href="https://www.justinm.one/blog/2021/09/11/fullstackrust/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Stack Rust - Blog</a>。</p>
<p>一年前，我的首选语言如下：</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 用于高级代码快速原型设计，或用于需要第三方功能的代码</li>
<li>C/C++ 用于长期的 low-level 项目</li>
</ul>
<p>当时只听过 Rust 并简单使用过，我的经验来自用 Rust 写了一个处理大文件（&gt;4GB）的事务并从中挖掘一些统计信息的小工具。我用了一个库将文件映射到内存，缤瑞按照顺序对其进行分析。有一些很酷的概念，比如编译器静态地强制内存映射在它被取消映射后无法访问——如果你不小心，C++ 中可能就会发生这种错误。</p>
<p>不过当时并没有真正吸引我，因为那只是一个小新奇。当我向 <a href="https://github.com/DrChat/pdblister" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdblister</a> 添加新功能以并行获取数千个 PDB 文件时诀窍来了。由于 GIL，在 CPython 中几乎不可能，而在 C/C++ 中做到不面临并行错误是极其困难的。然而 Rust 让这变得容易。我添加了 tokio 驱动的异步，使用 <code>tokio::spawn</code> 生成新任务来下载 PDB，并修复了编译器报的错误，它可以正常工作了。Rust 编译器输出一个二进制文件，它可以在任何地方运行，没有运行时依赖。</p>
<p><strong>取代 Python</strong></p>
<p>这是第一点，Rust 是 Python 作为中长期工具语言的绝佳替代品。Python 的好处是庞大的库和生态系统，通过 pip 可以直接拿到，想要快速制作与 API 交互的原型，可以使用 <code>requests</code>，只要 <code>import requests</code> 就可以使用了。Rust 的 <code>reqwest </code> 也是如此，只要输入 <code>cargo add reqwest</code> 就可以在代码中使用它。</p>
<p>然而当进入更长期的生命周期时，Python 就显示出劣势，<code>requests</code> 是程序的依赖，用户需要后去后才能使用。此外，由于弱类型和错误处理能力（与 Rust 比），Python 变得更加劣势。这一点上，我可以使用 Rust 比使用 Python 更快地编写原型工具，并且我可以自信地知道我的工具比等效的 Python 更易于维护且寿命更长。但是，对于短期工具，Python 可能仍然更好，因为它不需要启动项目即可在 VSCode 中获得智能感知支持。 Rust 的 cargo-script 接近将 Rust 推入脚本语言的领域，但不幸的是，我还没有在 VSCode 中找到与之集成的插件。</p>
<p><strong>取代 C</strong></p>
<p>Rust 也是 C 的直接替代品，它在各方面都更好，并且可以与遗留 C 代码原生互操作以进行增量替换。Rust 最大的改进是生态系统：如上所述，利用 Rust 生态中已有的库是很容易的。如果你从未使用过 C，那很幸运，实际上 C 中使用高级功能的最佳方法是自己写。</p>
<p>C 生态系统是支离破碎的，而且很脆弱。ABI 或构建系统没有一致的标准：</p>
<ul>
<li>由于缺乏 ABI 一致性，你不能跨平台或操作系统使用相同的二进制文件。 所以你必须从源代码构建。</li>
<li>由于缺乏一致的构建系统，你不能简单地和应用程序一起构建 C 库，必须修补或重写要使其与你的库兼容的库的构建系统。</li>
<li>C 库很少跨平台兼容，因为它们缺乏可以依赖的共享抽象。</li>
</ul>
<p>然后还有 Rust 最特色的安全改进——我就不展开了。但根据我的经验 - 安全性在很大程度上是一种工具，可以让第三方库开发人员更容易强迫我正确使用他们的库，这是 C 库不能做的事情。</p>
<p><strong>全栈 Rust</strong></p>
<p>总而言之，在过去的一年中，我一直在堆栈的所有部分使用 Rust，而我之前使用过其他语言。我已经使用 Rust 来实现引导加载程序：<a href="https://github.com/xenia-project/xell-rs" rel="noopener noreferrer">xenia-project/xell-rs: Xell Bootloader, rewritten in Rust because ¯_(ツ)_/¯，</a>我已经使用它通过 <a href="https://github.com/DrChat/pdblister" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdblister</a> 和 <a href="https://github.com/panamax-rs/panamax" rel="noopener noreferrer">panamax</a> 中的高级 HTTP/HTTPS 和其他技术来镜像文件。我利用并贡献了优秀的 <a href="https://github.com/DrChat/gdbstub" rel="noopener noreferrer">gdbstub</a> 库，用于控制由自定义 VMM 运行的 VM。这些项目都是在堆栈的不同级别完成的，而 Rust 非常适合所有级别。 我已经开始在我的个人项目中专门使用 Rust，并在适合的时候推动它在我的工作中使用。</p>
<h3>tagged_cell：快速、可初始化和线程安全的静态变量</h3>
<p>通过 <code>TaggedCell</code> 和 <code>Tag</code> 类型实现，为了安全操作，<code>TaggedCell</code> 的每个实例都必须是唯一的。然后必须通过 <code>TaggedCell::init ()</code> 初始化 <code>TaggedCell</code>，它使用用户提供的函数或闭包初始化底层数据，然后返回一个特殊的零大小的 <code>Init&lt;Tag&gt;</code> 用于访问 Cell 的数据。为了确保每个单元格使用唯一的标签类型，<code>tagged_cell!</code> 提供宏。该宏根据变量的名称创建一个新的标记类型，并将其应用到声明中。</p>
<pre><code>use tagged_cell::tagged_cell;
tagged_cell!{
   static BAR: TaggedCell&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;, _&gt; = TaggedCell::new();
}

let tag = BAR.init(|| vec![0, 10, 20]);
let vec = BAR.get(tag);

assert_eq!(vec[2], 20);
</code></pre>
<p>为了允许跨线程使用，只有第一次调用 <code>TaggedCell::init</code> 才会初始化 Cell 的数据。所有未来的 <code>TaggedCell::init</code> 调用都将返回一个新标签。未确定哪个线程将初始化 Cell 的数据。</p>
<pre><code>use std::thread;
use tagged_cell::tagged_cell;

tagged_cell!{
    static TABLE: TaggedCell&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;, _&gt; = TaggedCell::new();
}

thread::spawn(move || {
    let tag = TABLE.init(|| vec![0, 10, 20]);
    let table = TABLE.get(tag);
    assert_eq!(table[2], 20);
});

thread::spawn(move || {
    let tag = TABLE.init(|| vec![0, 10, 20]);
    let table = TABLE.get(tag);
    assert_eq!(table[1], 10);
});

<h3>ukanren-rs：µKanren 的 Rust 实现</h3>
<p>µKanren 是一种轻量级关系编程语言</p>
<ul>
<li>原始的 Schema 实现在这里：<a href="https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren" rel="noopener noreferrer">jasonhemann/microKanren: The implementation of microKanren, a featherweight relational programming language</a></li>
<li>相关参考：<a href="http://minikanren.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniKanren.org</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>use ukanren::*;

fn appendo(first: Value, second: Value, out: Value) -&gt; BoxedGoal&lt;impl Iterator&lt;Item = State&gt;&gt; {
    eq(&amp;first, &amp;())
        .and(eq(&amp;second, &amp;out))
        .or(fresh(move |a: Value, d: Value, res: Value| {
            eq(&amp;(a.clone(), d.clone()), &amp;first)
                .and(eq(&amp;(a.clone(), res.clone()), &amp;out))
                .and(appendo(d.clone(), second.clone(), res))
        }))
        .boxed()
}

let goal = fresh(|x, y| appendo(x, y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].to_value()));
assert_eq!(
    goal.run(2).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;(),
    vec![
        state![(), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]],
        state![[1], [2, 3, 4, 5]],
        state![[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]],
        state![[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]],
        state![[1, 2, 3, 4], [5]],
        state![[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ()],
    ],
);

<h3>rust-counter-strings：快速定位字符串位置</h3>
<p>字符串中的每个星号都出现在由紧接前面的数字指定的位置。因此，29 后面的星号是该字符串中的第 29 个字符。可以在任何地方砍掉字符串的末尾，并且确切地知道它在哪里被剪掉了。比如不用数就知道字符串 <code>2*4*6*8*11*14*17*2</code> 正好有 18 个字符。当处理 50 万个字符时会比较省事。</p>
<pre><code>$ ./rust-counter-strings 50
# 2*4*6*8*11*14*17*20*23*26*29*32*35*38*41*44*47*50*
</code></pre>
<p>这就是个小工具，代码也只有几十行。</p>

<h3>ferros</h3>
<p>seL4 是一个用于构建操作系统和嵌入式程序的工具包，这个开源项目是使 Rust 中的 seL4 编程变得更好。</p>
<p>以下代码演练假定使用示例 sel4_start 库执行 selfe，并介绍了 ferros 的某些方面。</p>
<pre><code>use selfe_sys;
use ferros::alloc::{self, micro_alloc, smart_alloc};
use ferros::userland::{root_cnode, BootInfo};

// The raw boot info is provided by the sel4_start library
let raw_boot_info: &amp;'static selfe_sys::seL4_BootInfo = unsafe { &amp;*sel4_start::BOOTINFO };


// Utility for finding and claiming `Untyped` instances supplied by the boot info.
let mut allocator = micro_alloc::Allocator::bootstrap(&amp;raw_boot_info)?;
let initial_untyped = allocator
    .get_untyped::&lt;U20&gt;() // The size of the Untyped instance, as bits
    .expect("Couldn't find an untyped instance of the desired size");

// Create the top-level CNode wrapper with type-level-tracked remaining slot capacity
let (root_cnode, local_slots) = root_cnode(&amp;raw_boot_info);

// Once we have an initial Untyped instance, memory distribution from it
// can be tracked with compile-time checks. The smart_alloc macro synthesizes
// the allocation code, and the capacity bounds are statically verified by
// the type checker. The effect is that you can write 'slots' in the macro body 
// anywhere you need some slots, and you'll get the right number allocated
// with type inference. A reference to 'ut' does the same for untyped memory. 
smart_alloc!(|slots from local_slots, ut from uts| {

    // Create a page table seL4 kernel object and return a capability pointer to it.
    // Here we use a variable binding type annotation and Rust's type system can figure out
    // if it can allocate a large enough Untyped instance and enough cnode slots
    // to represent this particular kernel object.
    let example_page_table: LocalCap&lt;UnmappedPageTable&gt; = retype(ut, slots)?;

    // Create a resource-tracking wrapper around the raw boot info to assist in
    // virtual memory related operations.
    let boot_info  = BootInfo::wrap(raw_boot_info, ut, slots);
    let (root_page_table, boot_info) = boot_info.map_page_table(root_page_table)?;
});

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://rustcc.cn/article?id=c36da117-d84e-42a0-9304-b02fe6f27df1">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><h1>Rust 1.55 稳定版发布</h1>
<p>Rust 1.55 是 2021 Edition 正式发布之前的倒数第二个版本，此版本主要更新如下：</p>
<ul>
<li>range 操作符支持半开语法</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>match x as u32 {
      0 =&gt; println!("zero!"),
      1.. =&gt; println!("positive number!"),
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>极大的提高浮点数的解析速度</li>
</ul>
<p>采用新的 Eisel-Lemire 算法解析浮点数，不仅在速度上有很大提升，之前一些解析失败的边缘 case 也全都修复了</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cargo 构建的时候不再重复报 Error</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>细化 io::ErrorKind</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>使用 ErrorKind::Other 来区分标准库之外产生的 io Error，标准库之内不会再产生 ErrorKind::Other 的 Error。标准库未来暂未分类的 Error 类型，统一使用 Uncategorized。</p>
<ul>
<li>数组增加 map() 方法</li>
</ul>
<p>数组的 map() 方法返回的依然是数组，对数组来说更方便！</p>
<ul>
<li>稳定 ops::ControlFlow</li>
</ul>
<p>这是未来要稳定的 <code>try trait v2</code> 的一部分。</p>
<pre><code>pub enum ControlFlow&lt;B, C = ()&gt; {
    Continue(C),
    Break(B),
}
</code></pre>
<p>标准库里面很多地方都用到了这个类型，很有用。</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo clippy --fix</code> 可以自动帮你修复 clippy 的警告</li>
</ul>
<p>这个非常赞！</p>

<h1>纪念 Anna Harren</h1>
<p>Anna Harren 是第一个将 Rust 的 ::&lt;&gt; 语法命名为 Turbofish 的人。</p>
<p>Rust 官方发布 1.55 的时候在博客里还特意纪念了最近刚去世的 Anna Harren。</p>

<h1>Rustaceans 准则</h1>
<p>Niko 发布了一篇博客，总结出 Rustaceans 的准则，比如其中提到：</p>
<p><strong>Rust empowers by being…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>⚙️ Reliable: “if it compiles, it works”</li>
<li>🐎 Performant: “idiomatic code runs efficiently”</li>
<li>🥰 Supportive: “the language, tools, and community are here to help”</li>
<li>🧩 Productive: “a little effort does a lot of work”</li>
<li>🔧 Transparent: “you can predict and control low-level details”</li>
<li>🤸 Versatile: “you can do anything with Rust”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Rustacean</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>💖 Be kind and considerate</li>
<li>✨ Bring joy to the user</li>
<li>👋 Show up</li>
<li>🔭 Recognize others’ knowledge</li>
<li>🔁 Start somewhere</li>
<li>✅ Follow through</li>
<li>🤝 Pay it forward</li>
<li>🎁 Trust and delegate</li>
</ul>

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04500">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>We introduce a Recursive INsertion-based Encoder (RINE), a novel approach for
semantic parsing in task-oriented dialog. Our model consists of an encoder
network that incrementally builds the semantic parse tree by predicting the
non-terminal label and its positions in the linearized tree. At the generation
time, the model constructs the semantic parse tree by recursively inserting the
predicted non-terminal labels at the predicted positions until termination.
RINE achieves state-of-the-art exact match accuracy on low- and high-resource
versions of the conversational semantic parsing benchmark TOP (Gupta et al.,
2018; Chen et al., 2020), outperforming strong sequence-to-sequence models and
transition-based parsers. We also show that our model design is applicable to
nested named entity recognition task, where it performs on par with
state-of-the-art approach designed for that task. Finally, we demonstrate that
our approach is 2-3.5 times faster than the sequence-to-sequence model at
inference time.

<span><p>We present models which complete missing text given transliterations of
ancient Mesopotamian documents, originally written on cuneiform clay tablets
(2500 BCE - 100 CE). Due to the tablets' deterioration, scholars often rely on
contextual cues to manually fill in missing parts in the text in a subjective
and time-consuming process. We identify that this challenge can be formulated
as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for
contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures
focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that
despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance
on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and
pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods. Finally,
we conduct human evaluations showing the applicability of our models in
assisting experts to transcribe texts in extinct languages.

<span><p>Extracting moral sentiment from text is a vital component in understanding
public opinion, social movements, and policy decisions. The Moral Foundation
Theory identifies five moral foundations, each associated with a positive and

which can correspond to individuals or collective entities. In this paper, we
introduce morality frames, a representation framework for organizing moral
attitudes directed at different entities, and come up with a novel and
high-quality annotated dataset of tweets written by US politicians. Then, we
propose a relational learning model to predict moral attitudes towards entities
and moral foundations jointly. We do qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
showing that moral sentiment towards entities differs highly across political

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04543">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Style transfer aims to rewrite a source text in a different target style
while preserving its content. We propose a novel approach to this task that
leverages generic resources, and without using any task-specific parallel
(source-target) data outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on the two
most popular style transfer tasks: formality transfer and polarity swap. In
practice, we adopt a multi-step procedure which builds on a generic pre-trained
sequence-to-sequence model (BART). First, we strengthen the model's ability to
rewrite by further pre-training BART on both an existing collection of generic
paraphrases, as well as on synthetic pairs created using a general-purpose
lexical resource. Second, through an iterative back-translation approach, we
train two models, each in a transfer direction, so that they can provide each
other with synthetically generated pairs, dynamically in the training process.
Lastly, we let our best reresulting model generate static synthetic pairs to be
used in a supervised training regime. Besides methodology and state-of-the-art
results, a core contribution of this work is a reflection on the nature of the
two tasks we address, and how their differences are highlighted by their
response to our approach.

<span><p>We study the problem of generating arithmetic math word problems (MWPs) given

this paper, we develop a novel MWP generation approach that leverages i)
pre-trained language models and a context keyword selection model to improve
the language quality of the generated MWPs and ii) an equation consistency
constraint for math equations to improve the mathematical validity of the
generated MWPs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three
real-world MWP datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04550">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Temporal Knowledge Graphs store events in the form of subjects, relations,
objects, and timestamps which are often represented by dynamic heterogeneous
graphs. Event forecasting is a critical and challenging task in Temporal
Knowledge Graph reasoning that predicts the subject or object of an event in
the future. To obtain temporal embeddings multi-step away in the future,
existing methods learn generative models that capture the joint distribution of
the observed events. To reduce the high computation costs, these methods rely
on unrealistic assumptions of independence and approximations in training and
inference. In this work, we propose SeDyT, a discriminative framework that
performs sequence modeling on the dynamic entity embeddings to solve the
multi-step event forecasting problem. SeDyT consists of two components: a
Temporal Graph Neural Network that generates dynamic entity embeddings in the
past and a sequence model that predicts the entity embeddings in the future.
Compared with the generative models, SeDyT does not rely on any heuristic-based
probability model and has low computation complexity in both training and
inference. SeDyT is compatible with most Temporal Graph Neural Networks and
sequence models. We also design an efficient training method that trains the
two components in one gradient descent propagation. We evaluate the performance
of SeDyT on five popular datasets. By combining temporal Graph Neural Network
models and sequence models, SeDyT achieves an average of 2.4% MRR improvement
when not using the validation set and more than 10% MRR improvement when using
the validation set.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04552">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Selective rationalization aims to produce decisions along with rationales
(e.g., text highlights or word alignments between two sentences). Commonly,
rationales are modeled as stochastic binary masks, requiring sampling-based
gradient estimators, which complicates training and requires careful
hyperparameter tuning. Sparse attention mechanisms are a deterministic
alternative, but they lack a way to regularize the rationale extraction (e.g.,
to control the sparsity of a text highlight or the number of alignments). In
this paper, we present a unified framework for deterministic extraction of
structured explanations via constrained inference on a factor graph, forming a
differentiable layer. Our approach greatly eases training and rationale
regularization, generally outperforming previous work on what comes to
performance and plausibility of the extracted rationales. We further provide a
comparative study of stochastic and deterministic methods for rationale
extraction for classification and natural language inference tasks, jointly
assessing their predictive power, quality of the explanations, and model
variability.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04556">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>State-of-the-art multilingual systems rely on shared vocabularies that
sufficiently cover all considered languages. To this end, a simple and
frequently used approach makes use of subword vocabularies constructed jointly
over several languages. We hypothesize that such vocabularies are suboptimal
due to false positives (identical subwords with different meanings across
languages) and false negatives (different subwords with similar meanings). To
address these issues, we propose Subword Mapping and Anchoring across Languages
(SMALA), a method to construct bilingual subword vocabularies. SMALA extracts
subword alignments using an unsupervised state-of-the-art mapping technique and
uses them to create cross-lingual anchors based on subword similarities. We
demonstrate the benefits of SMALA for cross-lingual natural language inference
(XNLI), where it improves zero-shot transfer to an unseen language without
task-specific data, but only by sharing subword embeddings. Moreover, in neural
machine translation, we show that joint subword vocabularies obtained with
SMALA lead to higher BLEU scores on sentences that contain many false positives
and false negatives.

<span><p>Human conversations naturally evolve around different topics and fluently
move between them. In research on dialog systems, the ability to actively and
smoothly transition to new topics is often ignored. In this paper we introduce
TIAGE, a new topic-shift aware dialog benchmark constructed utilizing human
annotations on topic shifts. Based on TIAGE, we introduce three tasks to
investigate different scenarios of topic-shift modeling in dialog settings:
topic-shift detection, topic-shift triggered response generation and
topic-aware dialog generation. Experiments on these tasks show that the
topic-shift signals in TIAGE are useful for topic-shift response generation. On
the other hand, dialog systems still struggle to decide when to change topic.
This indicates further research is needed in topic-shift aware dialog modeling.

<span><p>Transformer-based models have gained increasing popularity achieving
state-of-the-art performance in many research fields including speech
translation. However, Transformer's quadratic complexity with respect to the
input sequence length prevents its adoption as is with audio signals, which are
typically represented by long sequences. Current solutions resort to an initial
sub-optimal compression based on a fixed sampling of raw audio features.
Therefore, potentially useful linguistic information is not accessible to
higher-level layers in the architecture. To solve this issue, we propose
Speechformer, an architecture that, thanks to reduced memory usage in the
attention layers, avoids the initial lossy compression and aggregates
information only at a higher level according to more informed linguistic
criteria. Experiments on three language pairs (en-&gt;de/es/nl) show the efficacy
of our solution, with gains of up to 0.8 BLEU on the standard MuST-C corpus and
of up to 4.0 BLEU in a low resource scenario.

To address this problem, we propose query-driven segment selection from long

emerging ideas. One result of this tension is the formation of new
compositions, such that existing linguistic units can be combined with emerging
items into novel expressions. We develop a framework that exploits the
cognitive mechanisms of chaining and multimodal knowledge to predict emergent
compositional expressions through time. We present the syntactic frame
extension model (SFEM) that draws on the theory of chaining and knowledge from
"percept", "concept", and "language" to infer how verbs extend their frames to
form new compositions with existing and novel nouns. We evaluate SFEM
rigorously on the 1) modalities of knowledge and 2) categorization models of
chaining, in a syntactically parsed English corpus over the past 150 years. We
show that multimodal SFEM predicts newly emerged verb syntax and arguments
substantially better than competing models using purely linguistic or unimodal
knowledge. We find support for an exemplar view of chaining as opposed to a
prototype view and reveal how the joint approach of multimodal chaining may be
fundamental to the creation of literal and figurative language uses including

absent keyphrases. To address these problems, we propose a novel graph-based
method that can capture explicit knowledge from related references. Our model
first retrieves some document-keyphrases pairs similar to the source document
from a pre-defined index as references. Then a heterogeneous graph is
constructed to capture relationships of different granularities between the
source document and its references. To guide the decoding process, a
hierarchical attention and copy mechanism is introduced, which directly copies
appropriate words from both the source document and its references based on
their relevance and significance. The experimental results on multiple KG
benchmarks show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements
against other baseline models, especially with regard to the absent keyphrase
prediction.

<span><p>Zero-shot translation, directly translating between language pairs unseen in
training, is a promising capability of multilingual neural machine translation
(NMT). However, it usually suffers from capturing spurious correlations between
the output language and language invariant semantics due to the maximum
likelihood training objective, leading to poor transfer performance on
zero-shot translation. In this paper, we introduce a denoising autoencoder
objective based on pivot language into traditional training objective to
improve the translation accuracy on zero-shot directions. The theoretical
analysis from the perspective of latent variables shows that our approach
actually implicitly maximizes the probability distributions for zero-shot
directions. On two benchmark machine translation datasets, we demonstrate that
the proposed method is able to effectively eliminate the spurious correlations
and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Victorwz/zs-nmt-dae.

study domain adaptation under budget constraints, and approach it as a customer
choice problem between data annotation and pre-training. Specifically, we
measure the annotation cost of three procedural text datasets and the
pre-training cost of three in-domain language models. Then we evaluate the
utility of different combinations of pre-training and data annotation under
varying budget constraints to assess which combination strategy works best. We
find that, for small budgets, spending all funds on annotation leads to the
best performance; once the budget becomes large enough, a combination of data

patterns without considering the sequential features of the text. They are also
sub-optimal in capturing the context-level information in longer sequences.
This paper presents a novel Dual-State Capsule (DS-Caps) network-based

Two varieties of states, namely sentence-level and word-level, are integrated

<span><p>Multi-turn response selection models have recently shown comparable
performance to humans in several benchmark datasets. However, in the real
environment, these models often have weaknesses, such as making incorrect
predictions based heavily on superficial patterns without a comprehensive
understanding of the context. For example, these models often give a high score
to the wrong response candidate containing several keywords related to the
context but using the inconsistent tense. In this study, we analyze the
weaknesses of the open-domain Korean Multi-turn response selection models and
publish an adversarial dataset to evaluate these weaknesses. We also suggest a
strategy to build a robust model in this adversarial environment.

<span><p>In recent years, with the expansion of the Internet and attractive social
media infrastructures, people prefer to follow the news through these media.
Despite the many advantages of these media in the news field, the lack of any
control and verification mechanism has led to the spread of fake news, as one
of the most important threats to democracy, economy, journalism and freedom of
expression. Designing and using automatic methods to detect fake news on social
media has become a significant challenge. In this paper, we examine the
publishers' role in detecting fake news on social media. We also suggest a high
accurate multi-modal framework, namely FR-Detect, using user-related and
content-related features with early detection capability. For this purpose, two
new user-related features, namely Activity Credibility and Influence, have been
introduced for publishers. Furthermore, a sentence-level convolutional neural
network is provided to combine these features with latent textual content
features properly. Experimental results have shown that the publishers'
features can improve the performance of content-based models by up to 13% and

extends structured methods by considering blocks of any size and integrates
this structure into the movement pruning paradigm for fine-tuning. We find that
this approach learns to prune out full components of the underlying model, such

<span><p>Labeling data can be an expensive task as it is usually performed manually by
domain experts. This is cumbersome for deep learning, as it is dependent on
large labeled datasets. Active learning (AL) is a paradigm that aims to reduce
labeling effort by only using the data which the used model deems most
informative. Little research has been done on AL in a text classification
setting and next to none has involved the more recent, state-of-the-art NLP
models. Here, we present an empirical study that compares different
uncertainty-based algorithms with BERT$_{base}$ as the used classifier. We
evaluate the algorithms on two NLP classification datasets: Stanford Sentiment
Treebank and KvK-Frontpages. Additionally, we explore heuristics that aim to
solve presupposed problems of uncertainty-based AL; namely, that it is
unscalable and that it is prone to selecting outliers. Furthermore, we explore
the influence of the query-pool size on the performance of AL. Whereas it was
found that the proposed heuristics for AL did not improve performance of AL;
our results show that using uncertainty-based AL with BERT$_{base}$ outperforms
random sampling of data. This difference in performance can decrease as the

proposed to facilitate cross-lingual transfer of multilingual pretrained models

language adapter for every language one wishes to support, which can be
impractical for languages with limited data. An intuitive solution is to use a
related language adapter for the new language variety, but we observe that this

the robustness of language adapters to uncovered languages without training new

Minimized Ensemble of Adapters (EMEA), a method that optimizes the ensemble

<span><p>An important task in NLP applications such as sentence simplification is the
ability to take a long, complex sentence and split it into shorter sentences,
rephrasing as necessary. We introduce a novel dataset and a new model for this
`split and rephrase' task. Our BiSECT training data consists of 1 million long
English sentences paired with shorter, meaning-equivalent English sentences. We
obtain these by extracting 1-2 sentence alignments in bilingual parallel
corpora and then using machine translation to convert both sides of the corpus
into the same language. BiSECT contains higher quality training examples than
previous Split and Rephrase corpora, with sentence splits that require more
significant modifications. We categorize examples in our corpus, and use these
categories in a novel model that allows us to target specific regions of the
input sentence to be split and edited. Moreover, we show that models trained on
BiSECT can perform a wider variety of split operations and improve upon
previous state-of-the-art approaches in automatic and human evaluations.

XLM-RoBERTa, have achieved impressive cross-lingual transfer capabilities. In
the zero-shot transfer setting, only English training data is used, and the
fine-tuned model is evaluated on another target language. While this works
surprisingly well, substantial variance has been observed in target language
performance between different fine-tuning runs, and in the zero-shot setup, no
target-language development data is available to select among multiple
fine-tuned models. Prior work has relied on English dev data to select among

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09697">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The capacity of neural networks like the widely adopted transformer is known
to be very high. Evidence is emerging that they learn successfully due to
inductive bias in the training routine, typically a variant of gradient descent
(GD). To better understand this bias, we study the tendency for transformer
parameters to grow in magnitude ($\ell_2$ norm) during training, and its
implications for the emergent representations within self attention layers.
Empirically, we document norm growth in the training of transformer language
models, including T5 during its pretraining. As the parameters grow in
magnitude, we prove that the network approximates a discretized network with
saturated activation functions. Such "saturated" networks are known to have a
reduced capacity compared to the full network family that can be described in
terms of formal languages and automata. Our results suggest saturation is a new
characterization of an inductive bias implicit in GD of particular interest for
NLP. We leverage the emergent discrete structure in a saturated transformer to
analyze the role of different attention heads, finding that some focus locally
on a small number of positions, while other heads compute global averages,
allowing counting. We believe understanding the interplay between these two
capabilities may shed further light on the structure of computation within
large transformers.

robustness equivalence and feature importance agreement. We find that

There is a large body of work in the NMT literature on analyzing the behavior
of conventional models for the problem of noise but Transformers are relatively
understudied in this context. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel
data-driven technique called Target Augmented Fine-tuning (TAFT) to incorporate

One important characteristic of our techniques is that they only impact the
training phase and do not impose any overhead at inference time. We evaluated
our techniques to translate the English--German pair in both directions and
observed that our models have a higher tolerance to noise. More specifically,
they perform with no deterioration where up to 10% of entire test words are

another. They are more inherently intuitive to humans to both produce and
comprehend. We propose a methodology to produce contrastive explanations for
classification models by modifying the representation to disregard
non-contrastive information, and modifying model behavior to only be based on
contrastive reasoning. Our method is based on projecting model representation
to a latent space that captures only the features that are useful (to the
model) to differentiate two potential decisions. We demonstrate the value of
contrastive explanations by analyzing two different scenarios, using both
high-level abstract concept attribution and low-level input token/span
attribution, on two widely used text classification tasks. Specifically, we
produce explanations for answering: for which label, and against which
alternative label, is some aspect of the input useful? And which aspects of the
input are useful for and against particular decisions? Overall, our findings
shed light on the ability of label-contrastive explanations to provide a more
accurate and finer-grained interpretability of a model's decision.

<span><p>Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting.
</p>
<p>Numerous natural language processing models have tried injecting commonsense
by using the ConceptNet knowledge base to improve performance on different
tasks. ConceptNet, however, is mostly crowdsourced from humans and may reflect
human biases such as "lawyers are dishonest." It is important that these biases
are not conflated with the notion of commonsense. We study this missing yet
important problem by first defining and quantifying biases in ConceptNet as two
types of representational harms: overgeneralization of polarized perceptions
and representation disparity. We find that ConceptNet contains severe biases
and disparities across four demographic categories. In addition, we analyze two
downstream models that use ConceptNet as a source for commonsense knowledge and
find the existence of biases in those models as well. We further propose a
filtered-based bias-mitigation approach and examine its effectiveness. We show
that our mitigation approach can reduce the issues in both resource and models
but leads to a performance drop, leaving room for future work to build fairer
and stronger commonsense models.

<span><p>Humans use commonsense reasoning (CSR) implicitly to produce natural and
coherent responses in conversations. Aiming to close the gap between current
response generation (RG) models and human communication abilities, we want to
understand why RG models respond as they do by probing RG model's understanding
of commonsense reasoning that elicits proper responses. We formalize the
problem by framing commonsense as a latent variable in the RG task and using
explanations for responses as textual form of commonsense. We collect 6k
annotated explanations justifying responses from four dialogue datasets and ask
humans to verify them and propose two probing settings to evaluate RG models'
CSR capabilities. Probing results show that models fail to capture the logical
relations between commonsense explanations and responses and fine-tuning on
in-domain data and increasing model sizes do not lead to understanding of CSR
for RG. We hope our study motivates more research in making RG models emulate
the human reasoning process in pursuit of smooth human-AI communication.

<span><p>Concept-to-text Natural Language Generation is the task of expressing an
input meaning representation in natural language. Previous approaches in this
task have been able to generalise to rare or unseen instances by relying on a
delexicalisation of the input. However, this often requires that the input
appears verbatim in the output text. This poses challenges in multilingual
settings, where the task expands to generate the output text in multiple
languages given the same input. In this paper, we explore the application of
multilingual models in concept-to-text and propose Language Agnostic
Delexicalisation, a novel delexicalisation method that uses multilingual
pretrained embeddings, and employs a character-level post-editing model to
inflect words in their correct form during relexicalisation. Our experiments
across five datasets and five languages show that multilingual models
outperform monolingual models in concept-to-text and that our framework
outperforms previous approaches, especially for low resource languages.

accuracy costs, by replacing the self-attention sublayers with simple linear
transformations that "mix" input tokens. These linear mixers, along with
standard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling
semantic relationships in several text classification tasks. Most surprisingly,
we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder
with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the
accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains 80% faster on
GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input
lengths, our FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the
"efficient" Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark, FNet matches the
accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across
all sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs).
Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint and is particularly efficient at
smaller model sizes; for a fixed speed and accuracy budget, small FNet models

static embedding of text. The latter approaches seek user-specific solutions by
generating user fingerprints. Such approaches are useful in predicting user's

<span><p>Key information extraction (KIE) from document images requires understanding
the contextual and spatial semantics of texts in two-dimensional (2D) space.
Many recent studies try to solve the task by developing pre-training language
models focusing on combining visual features from document images with texts
and their layout. On the other hand, this paper tackles the problem by going
back to the basic: effective combination of text and layout. Specifically, we
propose a pre-trained language model, named BROS (BERT Relying On Spatiality),
that encodes relative positions of texts in 2D space and learns from unlabeled
documents with area-masking strategy. With this optimized training scheme for
understanding texts in 2D space, BROS shows comparable or better performance
compared to previous methods on four KIE benchmarks (FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and
SciTSR) without relying on visual features. This paper also reveals two
real-world challenges in KIE tasks--(1) minimizing the error from incorrect
text ordering and (2) efficient learning from fewer downstream examples--and
demonstrates the superiority of BROS over previous methods. Our code will be

typechecks the program against the specification based on the refinement type
system, discharging the generated verification conditions with the SMT solver
Z3. We briefly introduce our refinement type system for the core calculus
Mini-Michelson of Michelson, which incorporates the characteristic features
such as compound datatypes (e.g., lists and pairs), higher-order functions, and

<span><p>In cross-lingual text classification, it is required that task-specific
training data in high-resource source languages are available, where the task
is identical to that of a low-resource target language. However, collecting
such training data can be infeasible because of the labeling cost, task
characteristics, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes an alternative
solution that uses only task-independent word embeddings of high-resource
languages and bilingual dictionaries. First, we construct a dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the
possibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The
remaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are
considered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the
heterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and
language-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.
Furthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many
incorrect translations. Its robustness allows the usage of a wider range of
dictionaries such as an automatically constructed dictionary and crowdsourced
dictionary, which are convenient for real-world applications.
