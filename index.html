<span><h3>Rust 的 Logging 推荐</h3>
<p>内容整理自 Reddit 的讨论：<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/pmdh6a/what_is_the_current_recommendation_for_logging_in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the current recommendation for logging in Rust? : rust</a>。</p>
<p>问题简述：除了标准的 <code>log</code>，还有不少选择：<code>env_logger</code>，<code>tracing</code>，<code>slog</code>，<code>simplelog</code> 等等，最佳实践是什么？</p>
<p>来自 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Koxiaet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koxiaet</a> 的答复：通常有两类与日志相关的 crate：日志接口和日志消费者。接口提供了想要记录某些东西时调用的函数，消费者处理将结构化日志数据格式化到某个地方（stderr 或文件）。两个主要的接口是 <code>log</code> 和 <code>tracing</code>，后者功能更强大因为它支持结构化日志记录，但前者更普遍。还有另一个结构化日志接口 slog，比 <code>tracing</code> 更古老但用的较少。每个日志接口都有自己生态系统，可以根据自己的需要选择。如果在写一个库，<code>log</code> 是个不错的选择，因为所有的日志记录接口都与它兼容。但如果你确实需要结构化日志记录，则可以改用 <code>tracing</code>，这取决于你的需求，比如你是需要写到文件还是只是终端。</p>

<h3>Rust 全栈</h3>
<p>本文是一篇博客翻译，来自：<a href="https://www.justinm.one/blog/2021/09/11/fullstackrust/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Stack Rust - Blog</a>。</p>
<p>一年前，我的首选语言如下：</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 用于高级代码快速原型设计，或用于需要第三方功能的代码</li>
<li>C/C++ 用于长期的 low-level 项目</li>
</ul>
<p>当时只听过 Rust 并简单使用过，我的经验来自用 Rust 写了一个处理大文件（&gt;4GB）的事务并从中挖掘一些统计信息的小工具。我用了一个库将文件映射到内存，缤瑞按照顺序对其进行分析。有一些很酷的概念，比如编译器静态地强制内存映射在它被取消映射后无法访问——如果你不小心，C++ 中可能就会发生这种错误。</p>
<p>不过当时并没有真正吸引我，因为那只是一个小新奇。当我向 <a href="https://github.com/DrChat/pdblister" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdblister</a> 添加新功能以并行获取数千个 PDB 文件时诀窍来了。由于 GIL，在 CPython 中几乎不可能，而在 C/C++ 中做到不面临并行错误是极其困难的。然而 Rust 让这变得容易。我添加了 tokio 驱动的异步，使用 <code>tokio::spawn</code> 生成新任务来下载 PDB，并修复了编译器报的错误，它可以正常工作了。Rust 编译器输出一个二进制文件，它可以在任何地方运行，没有运行时依赖。</p>
<p><strong>取代 Python</strong></p>
<p>这是第一点，Rust 是 Python 作为中长期工具语言的绝佳替代品。Python 的好处是庞大的库和生态系统，通过 pip 可以直接拿到，想要快速制作与 API 交互的原型，可以使用 <code>requests</code>，只要 <code>import requests</code> 就可以使用了。Rust 的 <code>reqwest </code> 也是如此，只要输入 <code>cargo add reqwest</code> 就可以在代码中使用它。</p>
<p>然而当进入更长期的生命周期时，Python 就显示出劣势，<code>requests</code> 是程序的依赖，用户需要后去后才能使用。此外，由于弱类型和错误处理能力（与 Rust 比），Python 变得更加劣势。这一点上，我可以使用 Rust 比使用 Python 更快地编写原型工具，并且我可以自信地知道我的工具比等效的 Python 更易于维护且寿命更长。但是，对于短期工具，Python 可能仍然更好，因为它不需要启动项目即可在 VSCode 中获得智能感知支持。 Rust 的 cargo-script 接近将 Rust 推入脚本语言的领域，但不幸的是，我还没有在 VSCode 中找到与之集成的插件。</p>
<p><strong>取代 C</strong></p>
<p>Rust 也是 C 的直接替代品，它在各方面都更好，并且可以与遗留 C 代码原生互操作以进行增量替换。Rust 最大的改进是生态系统：如上所述，利用 Rust 生态中已有的库是很容易的。如果你从未使用过 C，那很幸运，实际上 C 中使用高级功能的最佳方法是自己写。</p>
<p>C 生态系统是支离破碎的，而且很脆弱。ABI 或构建系统没有一致的标准：</p>
<ul>
<li>由于缺乏 ABI 一致性，你不能跨平台或操作系统使用相同的二进制文件。 所以你必须从源代码构建。</li>
<li>由于缺乏一致的构建系统，你不能简单地和应用程序一起构建 C 库，必须修补或重写要使其与你的库兼容的库的构建系统。</li>
<li>C 库很少跨平台兼容，因为它们缺乏可以依赖的共享抽象。</li>
</ul>
<p>然后还有 Rust 最特色的安全改进——我就不展开了。但根据我的经验 - 安全性在很大程度上是一种工具，可以让第三方库开发人员更容易强迫我正确使用他们的库，这是 C 库不能做的事情。</p>
<p><strong>全栈 Rust</strong></p>
<p>总而言之，在过去的一年中，我一直在堆栈的所有部分使用 Rust，而我之前使用过其他语言。我已经使用 Rust 来实现引导加载程序：<a href="https://github.com/xenia-project/xell-rs" rel="noopener noreferrer">xenia-project/xell-rs: Xell Bootloader, rewritten in Rust because ¯_(ツ)_/¯，</a>我已经使用它通过 <a href="https://github.com/DrChat/pdblister" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdblister</a> 和 <a href="https://github.com/panamax-rs/panamax" rel="noopener noreferrer">panamax</a> 中的高级 HTTP/HTTPS 和其他技术来镜像文件。我利用并贡献了优秀的 <a href="https://github.com/DrChat/gdbstub" rel="noopener noreferrer">gdbstub</a> 库，用于控制由自定义 VMM 运行的 VM。这些项目都是在堆栈的不同级别完成的，而 Rust 非常适合所有级别。 我已经开始在我的个人项目中专门使用 Rust，并在适合的时候推动它在我的工作中使用。</p>
<h3>tagged_cell：快速、可初始化和线程安全的静态变量</h3>
<p>通过 <code>TaggedCell</code> 和 <code>Tag</code> 类型实现，为了安全操作，<code>TaggedCell</code> 的每个实例都必须是唯一的。然后必须通过 <code>TaggedCell::init ()</code> 初始化 <code>TaggedCell</code>，它使用用户提供的函数或闭包初始化底层数据，然后返回一个特殊的零大小的 <code>Init&lt;Tag&gt;</code> 用于访问 Cell 的数据。为了确保每个单元格使用唯一的标签类型，<code>tagged_cell!</code> 提供宏。该宏根据变量的名称创建一个新的标记类型，并将其应用到声明中。</p>
<pre><code>use tagged_cell::tagged_cell;
tagged_cell!{
   static BAR: TaggedCell&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;, _&gt; = TaggedCell::new();
}

let tag = BAR.init(|| vec![0, 10, 20]);
let vec = BAR.get(tag);

assert_eq!(vec[2], 20);
</code></pre>
<p>为了允许跨线程使用，只有第一次调用 <code>TaggedCell::init</code> 才会初始化 Cell 的数据。所有未来的 <code>TaggedCell::init</code> 调用都将返回一个新标签。未确定哪个线程将初始化 Cell 的数据。</p>
<pre><code>use std::thread;
use tagged_cell::tagged_cell;

tagged_cell!{
    static TABLE: TaggedCell&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;, _&gt; = TaggedCell::new();
}

thread::spawn(move || {
    let tag = TABLE.init(|| vec![0, 10, 20]);
    let table = TABLE.get(tag);
    assert_eq!(table[2], 20);
});

thread::spawn(move || {
    let tag = TABLE.init(|| vec![0, 10, 20]);
    let table = TABLE.get(tag);
    assert_eq!(table[1], 10);
});

<p>字符串中的每个星号都出现在由紧接前面的数字指定的位置。因此，29 后面的星号是该字符串中的第 29 个字符。可以在任何地方砍掉字符串的末尾，并且确切地知道它在哪里被剪掉了。比如不用数就知道字符串 <code>2*4*6*8*11*14*17*2</code> 正好有 18 个字符。当处理 50 万个字符时会比较省事。</p>
<pre><code>$ ./rust-counter-strings 50
# 2*4*6*8*11*14*17*20*23*26*29*32*35*38*41*44*47*50*
</code></pre>
<p>这就是个小工具，代码也只有几十行。</p>

<h3>ferros</h3>
<p>seL4 是一个用于构建操作系统和嵌入式程序的工具包，这个开源项目是使 Rust 中的 seL4 编程变得更好。</p>
<p>以下代码演练假定使用示例 sel4_start 库执行 selfe，并介绍了 ferros 的某些方面。</p>
<pre><code>use selfe_sys;
use ferros::alloc::{self, micro_alloc, smart_alloc};
use ferros::userland::{root_cnode, BootInfo};

// The raw boot info is provided by the sel4_start library
let raw_boot_info: &amp;'static selfe_sys::seL4_BootInfo = unsafe { &amp;*sel4_start::BOOTINFO };


// Utility for finding and claiming `Untyped` instances supplied by the boot info.
let mut allocator = micro_alloc::Allocator::bootstrap(&amp;raw_boot_info)?;
let initial_untyped = allocator
    .get_untyped::&lt;U20&gt;() // The size of the Untyped instance, as bits
    .expect("Couldn't find an untyped instance of the desired size");

// Create the top-level CNode wrapper with type-level-tracked remaining slot capacity
let (root_cnode, local_slots) = root_cnode(&amp;raw_boot_info);

// Once we have an initial Untyped instance, memory distribution from it
// can be tracked with compile-time checks. The smart_alloc macro synthesizes
// the allocation code, and the capacity bounds are statically verified by
// the type checker. The effect is that you can write 'slots' in the macro body 
// anywhere you need some slots, and you'll get the right number allocated
// with type inference. A reference to 'ut' does the same for untyped memory. 
smart_alloc!(|slots from local_slots, ut from uts| {

    // Create a page table seL4 kernel object and return a capability pointer to it.
    // Here we use a variable binding type annotation and Rust's type system can figure out
    // if it can allocate a large enough Untyped instance and enough cnode slots
    // to represent this particular kernel object.
    let example_page_table: LocalCap&lt;UnmappedPageTable&gt; = retype(ut, slots)?;

    // Create a resource-tracking wrapper around the raw boot info to assist in
    // virtual memory related operations.
    let boot_info  = BootInfo::wrap(raw_boot_info, ut, slots);
    let (root_page_table, boot_info) = boot_info.map_page_table(root_page_table)?;
});

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>We present a grounded neural dialogue model that successfully collaborates
with people in a partially-observable reference game. We focus on a setting
where two agents each observe an overlapping part of a world context and need
to identify and agree on some object they share. Therefore, the agents should
pool their information and communicate pragmatically to solve the task. Our
dialogue agent accurately grounds referents from the partner's utterances using
a structured reference resolver, conditions on these referents using a
recurrent memory, and uses a pragmatic generation procedure to ensure the
partner can resolve the references the agent produces. We evaluate on the
OneCommon spatial grounding dialogue task (Udagawa and Aizawa 2019), involving
a number of dots arranged on a board with continuously varying positions,
sizes, and shades. Our agent substantially outperforms the previous state of
the art for the task, obtaining a 20% relative improvement in successful task
completion in self-play evaluations and a 50% relative improvement in success
in human evaluations.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Knowledge-dependent tasks typically use two sources of knowledge: parametric,
learned at training time, and contextual, given as a passage at inference time.
To understand how models use these sources together, we formalize the problem
of knowledge conflicts, where the contextual information contradicts the
learned information. Analyzing the behaviour of popular models, we measure
their over-reliance on memorized information (the cause of hallucinations), and
uncover important factors that exacerbate this behaviour. Lastly, we propose a
simple method to mitigate over-reliance on parametric knowledge, which
minimizes hallucination, and improves out-of-distribution generalization by
4%-7%. Our findings demonstrate the importance for practitioners to evaluate
model tendency to hallucinate rather than read, and show that our mitigation
strategy encourages generalization to evolving information (i.e.,
time-dependent queries). To encourage these practices, we have released our
framework for generating knowledge conflicts.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05056">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Dialogue Act (DA) classification is the task of classifying utterances with
respect to the function they serve in a dialogue. Existing approaches to DA
classification model utterances without incorporating the turn changes among
speakers throughout the dialogue, therefore treating it no different than
non-interactive written text. In this paper, we propose to integrate the turn
changes in conversations among speakers when modeling DAs. Specifically, we
learn conversation-invariant speaker turn embeddings to represent the speaker
turns in a conversation; the learned speaker turn embeddings are then merged
with the utterance embeddings for the downstream task of DA classification.
With this simple yet effective mechanism, our model is able to capture the
semantics from the dialogue content while accounting for different speaker
turns in a conversation. Validation on three benchmark public datasets
demonstrates superior performance of our model.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Neural language modelling has progressed the state-of-the-art in different
downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One such area is of
open-domain dialog modelling, neural dialog models based on GPT-2 such as
DialoGPT have shown promising performance in single-turn conversation. However,
such (neural) dialog models have been criticized for generating responses which
although may have relevance to the previous human response, tend to quickly
dissipate human interest and descend into trivial conversation. One reason for
such performance is the lack of explicit conversation strategy being employed
in human-machine conversation. Humans employ a range of conversation strategies
while engaging in a conversation, one such key social strategies is
Self-disclosure(SD). A phenomenon of revealing information about one-self to
others. Social penetration theory (SPT) proposes that communication between two
people moves from shallow to deeper levels as the relationship progresses
primarily through self-disclosure. Disclosure helps in creating rapport among
the participants engaged in a conversation. In this paper, Self-disclosure
enhancement architecture (SDEA) is introduced utilizing Self-disclosure Topic
Model (SDTM) during inference stage of a neural dialog model to re-rank
response candidates to enhance self-disclosure in single-turn responses from

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large pre-trained language models for textual data have an unconstrained
output space; at each decoding step, they can produce any of 10,000s of
sub-word tokens. When fine-tuned to target constrained formal languages like
SQL, these models often generate invalid code, rendering it unusable. We
propose PICARD (code and trained models available at
https://github.com/ElementAI/picard), a method for constraining auto-regressive
decoders of language models through incremental parsing. PICARD helps to find
valid output sequences by rejecting inadmissible tokens at each decoding step.
On the challenging Spider and CoSQL text-to-SQL translation tasks, we show that
PICARD transforms fine-tuned T5 models with passable performance into

representative syntactic pattern for intensification and systematically study
the semantic (commonsense and counterfactual) relationships between each

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05112">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>For over thirty years, researchers have developed and analyzed methods for
latent tree induction as an approach for unsupervised syntactic parsing.
Nonetheless, modern systems still do not perform well enough compared to their
supervised counterparts to have any practical use as structural annotation of
text. In this work, we present a technique that uses distant supervision in the
form of span constraints (i.e. phrase bracketing) to improve performance in
unsupervised constituency parsing. Using a relatively small number of span
constraints we can substantially improve the output from DIORA, an already
competitive unsupervised parsing system. Compared with full parse tree
annotation, span constraints can be acquired with minimal effort, such as with
a lexicon derived from Wikipedia, to find exact text matches. Our experiments
show span constraints based on entities improves constituency parsing on
English WSJ Penn Treebank by more than 5 F1. Furthermore, our method extends to
any domain where span constraints are easily attainable, and as a case study we
demonstrate its effectiveness by parsing biomedical text from the CRAFT
dataset.

on training technique that uses existing fully paired image-caption data and
the images with only the novel object detection labels (partially paired data).
We create synthetic paired captioning data for these novel objects by
leveraging context from existing image-caption pairs. We further re-use these
partially paired images with novel objects to create pseudo-label captions that
are used to fine-tune the captioning model. Using a popular captioning model
(Up-Down) as baseline, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on

deep representations of and connections between languages. We use both types of
pairs in MURAL (MUltimodal, MUltitask Representations Across Languages), a dual
encoder that solves two tasks: 1) image-text matching and 2) translation pair
matching. By incorporating billions of translation pairs, MURAL extends ALIGN
(Jia et al. PMLR'21)--a state-of-the-art dual encoder learned from 1.8 billion
noisy image-text pairs. When using the same encoders, MURAL's performance
matches or exceeds ALIGN's cross-modal retrieval performance on well-resourced
languages across several datasets. More importantly, it considerably improves
performance on under-resourced languages, showing that text-text learning can
overcome a paucity of image-caption examples for these languages. On the
Wikipedia Image-Text dataset, for example, MURAL-base improves zero-shot mean
recall by 8.1% on average for eight under-resourced languages and by 6.8% on
average when fine-tuning. We additionally show that MURAL's text

<span><p>Existing research studies on cross-sentence relation extraction in long-form
multi-party conversations aim to improve relation extraction without
considering the explainability of such methods. This work addresses that gap by
focusing on extracting explanations that indicate that a relation exists while
using only partially labeled data. We propose our model-agnostic framework,
D-REX, a policy-guided semi-supervised algorithm that explains and ranks
relations. We frame relation extraction as a re-ranking task and include
relation- and entity-specific explanations as an intermediate step of the
inference process. We find that about 90% of the time, human annotators prefer
D-REX's explanations over a strong BERT-based joint relation extraction and
explanation model. Finally, our evaluations on a dialogue relation extraction
dataset show that our method is simple yet effective and achieves a
state-of-the-art F1 score on relation extraction, improving upon existing

<span><p>Addressing the mismatch between natural language descriptions and the
corresponding SQL queries is a key challenge for text-to-SQL translation. To
bridge this gap, we propose an SQL intermediate representation (IR) called
Natural SQL (NatSQL). Specifically, NatSQL preserves the core functionalities
of SQL, while it simplifies the queries as follows: (1) dispensing with
operators and keywords such as GROUP BY, HAVING, FROM, JOIN ON, which are
usually hard to find counterparts for in the text descriptions; (2) removing
the need for nested subqueries and set operators; and (3) making schema linking
easier by reducing the required number of schema items. On Spider, a
challenging text-to-SQL benchmark that contains complex and nested SQL queries,
we demonstrate that NatSQL outperforms other IRs, and significantly improves
the performance of several previous SOTA models. Furthermore, for existing

<span><p>Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) datasets, such as ECB+, contain
manually annotated event-centric mentions of events and entities that form
coreference chains with identity relations. ECB+ is a state-of-the-art CDCR
dataset that focuses on the resolution of events and their descriptive
attributes, i.e., actors, location, and date-time. NewsWCL50 is a dataset that
annotates coreference chains of both events and entities with a strong variance
of word choice and more loosely-related coreference anaphora, e.g., bridging or
near-identity relations. In this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively
compare annotation schemes of ECB+ and NewsWCL50 with multiple criteria. We
propose a phrasing diversity metric (PD) that compares lexical diversity within
coreference chains on a more detailed level than previously proposed metric,
e.g., a number of unique lemmas. We discuss the different tasks that both CDCR
datasets create, i.e., lexical disambiguation and lexical diversity challenges,
and propose a direction for further CDCR evaluation.

<span><p>Datasets and methods for cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) focus
on events or entities with strict coreference relations. They lack, however,
annotating and resolving coreference mentions with more abstract or loose
relations that may occur when news articles report about controversial and
polarized events. Bridging and loose coreference relations trigger associations
that may lead to exposing news readers to bias by word choice and labeling. For
example, coreferential mentions of "direct talks between U.S. President Donald
Trump and Kim" such as "an extraordinary meeting following months of heated
rhetoric" or "great chance to solve a world problem" form a more positive
perception of this event. A step towards bringing awareness of bias by word
choice and labeling is the reliable resolution of coreferences with high
lexical diversity. We propose an unsupervised method named XCoref, which is a
CDCR method that capably resolves not only previously prevalent entities, such
as persons, e.g., "Donald Trump," but also abstractly defined concepts, such as
groups of persons, "caravan of immigrants," events and actions, e.g., "marching
to the U.S. border." In an extensive evaluation, we compare the proposed XCoref
to a state-of-the-art CDCR method and a previous method TCA that resolves such
complex coreference relations and find that XCoref outperforms these methods.
Outperforming an established CDCR model shows that the new CDCR models need to
be evaluated on semantically complex mentions with more loose coreference
relations to indicate their applicability of models to resolve mentions in the
"wild" of political news articles.

Regression (BTR) model that uses both text and numerical information to model
an outcome variable. It allows estimation of both discrete and continuous
treatment effects. Furthermore, it allows for the inclusion of additional
numerical confounding factors next to text data. To this end, we combine a
supervised Bayesian topic model with a Bayesian regression framework and
perform supervised representation learning for the text features jointly with
the regression parameter training, respecting the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem.
Our paper makes two main contributions. First, we provide a regression
framework that allows causal inference in settings when both text and numerical
confounders are of relevance. We show with synthetic and semi-synthetic
datasets that our joint approach recovers ground truth with lower bias than any
benchmark model, when text and numerical features are correlated. Second,
experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that a joint and supervised
learning strategy also yields superior prediction results compared to
strategies that estimate regression weights for text and non-text features
separately, being even competitive with more complex deep neural networks.

underexplored in NLP, but it is particularly important for high-value domains
such as biomedicine, where obtaining high recall of the latest findings is

extraction confined to short text spans, document-level relation extraction
faces additional challenges in both inference and learning. Given longer text
spans, state-of-the-art neural architectures are less effective and
task-specific self-supervision such as distant supervision becomes very noisy.
In this paper, we propose decomposing document-level relation extraction into

<span><p>In order to preserve word-order information in a non-autoregressive setting,
transformer architectures tend to include positional knowledge, by (for
instance) adding positional encodings to token embeddings. Several
modifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used
in the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance,
separating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying
attention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that
surprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language
models, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then
answer why that is: Sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate
compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.
Higher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher
compression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned
absolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal
embeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding
architectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn compositionality and
cross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings

<span><p>Internet search affects people's cognition of the world, so mitigating biases
in search results and learning fair models is imperative for social good. We
study a unique gender bias in image search in this work: the search images are
often gender-imbalanced for gender-neutral natural language queries. We
diagnose two typical image search models, the specialized model trained on
in-domain datasets and the generalized representation model pre-trained on
massive image and text data across the internet. Both models suffer from severe
gender bias. Therefore, we introduce two novel debiasing approaches: an
in-processing fair sampling method to address the gender imbalance issue for
training models, and a post-processing feature clipping method base on mutual
information to debias multimodal representations of pre-trained models.
Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks show that our methods
significantly reduce the gender bias in image search models.

achieved, existing models still perform suboptimally when handling hard FSRE

this is largely because existing models do not distinguish hard tasks from easy

acoustic models learned from the high-resource language through unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) schemes can enhance the performance of the ASR in the

Despite their strong performance, training a new self-supervised learning (SSL)
Transformer on any modality is not usually attainable due to insufficient data,

However, embeddings in the Euclidean space cannot capture richer asymmetric
relations such as event temporal relations. We thus propose to embed events
into hyperbolic spaces, which are intrinsically oriented at modeling
hierarchical structures. We introduce two approaches to encode events and their
temporal relations in hyperbolic spaces. One approach leverages hyperbolic
embeddings to directly infer event relations through simple geometrical
operations. In the second one, we devise an end-to-end architecture composed of
hyperbolic neural units tailored for the temporal relation extraction task.
Thorough experimental assessments on widely used datasets have shown the
benefits of revisiting the tasks on a different geometrical space, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance on several standard metrics. Finally, the ablation

Together, the two levels of attack produce natural adversarial examples that

<span><p>Paraphrase generation has benefited extensively from recent progress in the
designing of training objectives and model architectures. However, previous
explorations have largely focused on supervised methods, which require a large
amount of labeled data that is costly to collect. To address this drawback, we
adopt a transfer learning approach and propose a training pipeline that enables
pre-trained language models to generate high-quality paraphrases in an
unsupervised setting. Our recipe consists of task-adaptation, self-supervision,
and a novel decoding algorithm named Dynamic Blocking (DB). To enforce a
surface form dissimilar from the input, whenever the language model emits a
token contained in the source sequence, DB prevents the model from outputting
the subsequent source token for the next generation step. We show with
automatic and human evaluations that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the Quora Question Pair (QQP) and the ParaNMT datasets and
is robust to domain shift between the two datasets of distinct distributions.
We also demonstrate that our model transfers to paraphrasing in other languages
without any additional finetuning.

<span><p>End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are increasingly

rescoring model trained with these additional tasks outperforms the baseline
rescoring model, trained with only the language modeling task, by 1.4% on a

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Image captioning models generally lack the capability to take into account
user interest, and usually default to global descriptions that try to balance
readability, informativeness, and information overload. On the other hand, VQA
models generally lack the ability to provide long descriptive answers, while
expecting the textual question to be quite precise. We present a method to
control the concepts that an image caption should focus on, using an additional
input called the guiding text that refers to either groundable or ungroundable
concepts in the image. Our model consists of a Transformer-based multimodal
encoder that uses the guiding text together with global and object-level image
features to derive early-fusion representations used to generate the guided
caption. While models trained on Visual Genome data have an in-domain advantage
of fitting well when guided with automatic object labels, we find that guided
captioning models trained on Conceptual Captions generalize better on
out-of-domain images and guiding texts. Our human-evaluation results indicate
that attempting in-the-wild guided image captioning requires access to large,
unrestricted-domain training datasets, and that increased style diversity (even
without increasing the number of unique tokens) is a key factor for improved
performance.

language model which not only predicts the next word, but also its sense in
context. We argue that this higher prediction granularity may be useful for end

language models with knowledge bases. We find that multi-sense language
modelling requires architectures that go beyond standard language models, and
here propose a structured prediction framework that decomposes the task into a

perform the aggregation via simple average. However, little is known about how
the vector aggregation step affects the generation quality. In this study, we
revisit the commonly used simple average approach by examining the latent space

question-answering (QA) literature has failed to adequately address the answer
diversity of questions. To this end, we present GooAQ, a large-scale dataset
with a variety of answer types. This dataset contains over 5 million questions
and 3 million answers collected from Google. GooAQ questions are collected
semi-automatically from the Google search engine using its autocomplete
feature. This results in naturalistic questions of practical interest that are
nonetheless short and expressed using simple language. GooAQ answers are mined
from Google's responses to our collected questions, specifically from the
answer boxes in the search results. This yields a rich space of answer types,
containing both textual answers (short and long) as well as more structured
ones such as collections. We benchmarkT5 models on GooAQ and observe that: (a)
in line with recent work, LM's strong performance on GooAQ's short-answer
questions heavily benefit from annotated data; however, (b) their quality in
generating coherent and accurate responses for questions requiring long
responses (such as 'how' and 'why' questions) is less reliant on observing
annotated data and mainly supported by their pre-training. We release GooAQ to
facilitate further research on improving QA with diverse response types.

<span><p>To build robust question answering systems, we need the ability to verify
whether answers to questions are truly correct, not just "good enough" in the
context of imperfect QA datasets. We explore the use of natural language
inference (NLI) as a way to achieve this goal, as NLI inherently requires the
premise (document context) to contain all necessary information to support the
hypothesis (proposed answer to the question). We leverage large pre-trained
models and recent prior datasets to construct powerful question converter and
decontextualization modules, which can reformulate QA instances as
premise-hypothesis pairs with very high reliability. Then, by combining
standard NLI datasets with NLI examples automatically derived from QA training
data, we can train NLI models to judge the correctness of QA models' proposed
answers. We show that our NLI approach can generally improve the confidence
estimation of a QA model across different domains, evaluated in a selective QA
setting. Careful manual analysis over the predictions of our NLI model shows
that it can further identify cases where the QA model produces the right answer
for the wrong reason, or where the answer cannot be verified as addressing all
aspects of the question.

interference from the heterogeneous multilingual data and reduction in

the amount of data per language varying from 7.6K to 53.5K hours. We adopt
GShard [1] to efficiently scale up to 10B parameters. Empirically, we find that
(1) scaling the number of model parameters is an effective way to solve the
capacity bottleneck - our 500M-param model already outperforms monolingual
baselines and scaling it to 1B and 10B brought further quality gains; (2)
larger models are not only more data efficient, but also more efficient in
terms of training cost as measured in TPU days - the 1B-param model reaches the
same accuracy at 34% of training time as the 500M-param model; (3) given a
fixed capacity budget, adding depth works better than width and large encoders
do better than large decoders; (4) with continuous training, they can be

<span><p>A continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) is a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) with a domain $U \subset \mathbb{R}$. We engage in a
systematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete of the Existential Theory
of the Reals, i.e., ER-complete. To define this class, we first consider the
problem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the Reals. In an
instance of this problem we are given some sentence of the form $\exists x_1,
\ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R} : \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, where $\Phi$ is a
well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols $\{0, 1, +,
\cdot, \geq, &gt;, \wedge, \vee, \neg\}$, the goal is to check whether this
sentence is true. Now the class ER is the family of all problems that admit a
polynomial-time reduction to ETR. It is known that NP $\subseteq$ ER
$\subseteq$ PSPACE.
</p>
<p>We restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints ($x + y = z$)
and some other mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that
multiplication constraints ($x \cdot y = z$), squaring constraints ($x^2 = y$),
or inversion constraints ($x\cdot y = 1$) are sufficient to establish
ER-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality
constraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and some
other mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality
constraint ($f(x,y) = 0$) are ER-complete. We further extend our results to
inequality constraints. We show that any well-behaved convexly curved and any
well-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint ($f(x,y) \geq 0$ and
$g(x,y) \geq 0$) imply ER-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.
</p>
<p>We apply our findings to geometric packing and answer an open question by
Abrahamsen et al. [FOCS 2020]. Namely, we establish ER-completeness of packing
convex pieces into a square container under rotations and translations.

<span><p>The cross-lingual language models are typically pretrained with masked
language modeling on multilingual text or parallel sentences. In this paper, we
introduce denoising word alignment as a new cross-lingual pre-training task.
Specifically, the model first self-labels word alignments for parallel
sentences. Then we randomly mask tokens in a bitext pair. Given a masked token,
the model uses a pointer network to predict the aligned token in the other
language. We alternately perform the above two steps in an
expectation-maximization manner. Experimental results show that our method
improves cross-lingual transferability on various datasets, especially on the
token-level tasks, such as question answering, and structured prediction.
Moreover, the model can serve as a pretrained word aligner, which achieves
reasonably low error rates on the alignment benchmarks. The code and pretrained

fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers on ToxiChat that achieve 0.71 F1 for

<span><p>In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those

parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work has claimed, our auxiliary experiments suggest that
relation prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a

remains challenging to use vanilla adversarial training to improve NLP models'
performance, and the benefits are mainly uninvestigated. This paper proposes a
simple and improved vanilla adversarial training process for NLP models, which
we name Attacking to Training (A2T). The core part of A2T is a new and cheaper
word substitution attack optimized for vanilla adversarial training. We use A2T
to train BERT and RoBERTa models on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp, and SNLI
datasets. Our results empirically show that it is possible to train robust NLP
models using a much cheaper adversary. We demonstrate that vanilla adversarial
training with A2T can improve an NLP model's robustness to the attack it was
originally trained with and also defend the model against other types of word

<span><p>The task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is
of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (&lt; 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of

summarization directly pretrain models in other domains, e.g., the news domain,
but they generally neglect the huge difference between dialogues and

large-scale in-domain non-summary data to separately pretrain the dialogue
