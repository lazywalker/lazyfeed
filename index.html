<summary class="article-expander__title">【Rust日报】2021-09-10 Rust 1.55 稳定版发布</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://rustcc.cn/article?id=c36da117-d84e-42a0-9304-b02fe6f27df1">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><h1>Rust 1.55 稳定版发布</h1>
<p>Rust 1.55 是 2021 Edition 正式发布之前的倒数第二个版本，此版本主要更新如下：</p>
<ul>
<li>range 操作符支持半开语法</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>match x as u32 {
      0 =&gt; println!("zero!"),
      1.. =&gt; println!("positive number!"),
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>极大的提高浮点数的解析速度</li>
</ul>
<p>采用新的 Eisel-Lemire 算法解析浮点数，不仅在速度上有很大提升，之前一些解析失败的边缘 case 也全都修复了</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cargo 构建的时候不再重复报 Error</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>细化 io::ErrorKind</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>使用 ErrorKind::Other 来区分标准库之外产生的 io Error，标准库之内不会再产生 ErrorKind::Other 的 Error。标准库未来暂未分类的 Error 类型，统一使用 Uncategorized。</p>
<ul>
<li>数组增加 map() 方法</li>
</ul>
<p>数组的 map() 方法返回的依然是数组，对数组来说更方便！</p>
<ul>
<li>稳定 ops::ControlFlow</li>
</ul>
<p>这是未来要稳定的 <code>try trait v2</code> 的一部分。</p>
<pre><code>pub enum ControlFlow&lt;B, C = ()&gt; {
    Continue(C),
    Break(B),
}
</code></pre>
<p>标准库里面很多地方都用到了这个类型，很有用。</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo clippy --fix</code> 可以自动帮你修复 clippy 的警告</li>
</ul>
<p>这个非常赞！</p>

<h1>纪念 Anna Harren</h1>
<p>Anna Harren 是第一个将 Rust 的 ::&lt;&gt; 语法命名为 Turbofish 的人。</p>
<p>Rust 官方发布 1.55 的时候在博客里还特意纪念了最近刚去世的 Anna Harren。</p>

<h3>rcore tutorial book 更新了</h3>
<p>陈渝老师的rcore系列操作系统课程更新了:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>rCore-Tutorial-Book</code> 在暑假期间又进行了一轮修改，算是从0.35版进化到0.50版了。请对学习用Rust写OS感兴趣的朋友看看。如果有问题、建议，发现了bug，请直接在每节下方的交互窗口留言。如果想一起来参与写作，请直接联系 陈渝或吴一凡。谢谢！ 本书定位是以尽量简单的编程和尽量少的OS/CPU知识来逐步设计实现一个一个的小OS，让学生知道操作系统的概念的实际体现和操作系统的全貌。经过我们讨论，虽然这本书是基于单处理器讲解的，但觉得还是要加入OS的同步互斥支持，与传统方式不同，这一章主要讲解操作系统如何支持用户态线程的同步互斥操作。所以，目前还缺的是关于同步互斥的一章，各种图，相关OS历史的介绍，相关知识点的进一步补充。争取本月完成。</p>

<h3>Rust for Linux 研讨会 9.13 ～ 9.15</h3>
<p>9.13 分享：</p>
<ol>
<li>High Velocity Kernel Modules in Rust with Bento —— Samantha Miller</li>
</ol>
<p>Bento 是 Safe Rust 实现的 linux 内核 文件系统。 通过实现安全的 API 并使用安全的内核函数包装器，文件系统是用安全的 Rust 编写的。 这些安全接口尽可能接近现有的用户空间（主要是标准库）接口，因此只需将 Bento 包含更改为用户空间 Rust 库和/或 bento_utils 包含，就可以将文件系统重新编译为 FUSE 文件系统。更多信息：https://github.com/smiller123/bento</p>
<p>这次分享主要讨论 Bento ，用于加速 Linux 内核开发的框架。目前已经为文件系统模块实现了Bento框架，并利用它实现了一个性能类似于ext4的文件系统，可以在不卸载的情况下进行升级，而且只需要15ms的停机时间。我们目前正在努力扩展Bento，以支持自定义的TCP/IP堆栈。</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How can we formally verify Rust for Linux? —— Alastair Reid</li>
</ol>
<p>在Linux中使用Rust的目的是创建更稳固、更安全的代码：通过利用Rust的语言特性和设计一个安全的API供驱动程序使用，避免内存安全问题和并发问题。该分享研究了我们如何/是否可以利用自动形式验证工具走得更远。</p>
<p>9.14 分享：</p>
<ol>
<li>Rust key concepts for the Linux kernel (I) —— Miguel Ojeda</li>
</ol>
<p>介绍 在 Linux 内核领域应用 Rust 的一些关键概念，第一部分</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Thread wrapper for Rust in Linux kernel — Boqun Feng （冯博群）</li>
</ol>
<p>内核线程是内核中最重要的组件之一，它也是实现内核中其他核心子系统的必要环节。本专题将分享如何在Linux内核中实现Rust类线程的封装器的学习过程，以及目前的状况和未来的工作。</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Implementing the Iterator trait for seq_file —— Adam Bratschi-Kaye</li>
</ol>
<p>内核中的seq_file接口允许通过实现一个迭代可以打印的值的接口来轻松创建虚拟文件。这似乎应该直接转化为Rust的Iterator特性，其中Item实现了Display，但当然，魔鬼在细节中。该分享将展示如何为Rust代码提供seq_file的接口。</p>
<p>9.15 分享</p>
<ol>
<li>Rust key concepts for the Linux kernel (II) —— Wedson Almeida Filho</li>
</ol>
<p>介绍在 Linux 内核领域应用 Rust 的一些关键概念，第二部分</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Writing an embedded SPI-based Linux driver in Rust —— Arthur Cohen, Esteban Blanc, Martin Schmidt</li>
</ol>
<p>虽然Linux主要不是一个以嵌入式为重点的操作系统，但它仍然被用于诸如Raspberry Pi这样的平台。在这些平台上，内核模块提供了一种有用的方式，可以在内核层面与各种设备进行交互，这些设备通常使用低级协议进行通信，如SPI或I2C。</p>
<p>在这种工作负载中使用Rust有很多优势，虽然这些协议的内核API已经被尝试和测试了很长时间，但目前还没有Rust的抽象。</p>
<p>在该分享中，将谈论在ARM64平台上为Linux带来一个安全的Rust的SPI协议的抽象，以及如何使用它来实现一个简单的设备驱动程序。该分享将与C语言的原始实现进行比较，后者提供了同样多的功能。最后，将深入探讨所使用的技术和他们使用Rust-for-Linux的经验。</p>
<p>以上三天的研讨会，应该是线下的，因为并没有提供线上参与链接。</p>

<span><p>We study Comparative Preference Classification (CPC) which aims at predicting
whether a preference comparison exists between two entities in a given sentence
and, if so, which entity is preferred over the other. High-quality CPC models
can significantly benefit applications such as comparative question answering
and review-based recommendations. Among the existing approaches, non-deep
learning methods suffer from inferior performances. The state-of-the-art graph
neural network-based ED-GAT (Ma et al., 2020) only considers syntactic
information while ignoring the critical semantic relations and the sentiments
to the compared entities. We proposed sentiment Analysis Enhanced COmparative
Network (SAECON) which improves CPC ac-curacy with a sentiment analyzer that
learns sentiments to individual entities via domain adaptive knowledge
transfer. Experiments on the CompSent-19 (Panchenko et al., 2019) dataset
present a significant improvement on the F1 scores over the best existing CPC
approaches.

<span><p>Cyber intelligence is widely and abundantly available in numerous open online

we present and implement a novel knowledge graph and knowledge mining framework
for extracting relevant information from free-form text about incidents in the
cyber domain. Our framework includes a machine learning based pipeline as well
as crawling methods for generating graphs of entities, attackers and the
related information with our non-technical cyber ontology. We test our
framework on publicly available cyber incident datasets to evaluate the
accuracy of our knowledge mining methods as well as the usefulness of the
framework in the use of cyber analysts. Our results show analyzing the
knowledge graph constructed using the novel framework, an analyst can infer
additional information from the current cyber landscape in terms of risk to
various entities and the propagation of risk between industries and countries.
Expanding the framework to accommodate more technical and operational level

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03853">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pimentel et al. (2020) recently analysed probing from an
information-theoretic perspective. They argue that probing should be seen as
approximating a mutual information. This led to the rather unintuitive
conclusion that representations encode exactly the same information about a
target task as the original sentences. The mutual information, however, assumes
the true probability distribution of a pair of random variables is known,
leading to unintuitive results in settings where it is not. This paper proposes
a new framework to measure what we term Bayesian mutual information, which
analyses information from the perspective of Bayesian agents -- allowing for
more intuitive findings in scenarios with finite data. For instance, under
Bayesian MI we have that data can add information, processing can help, and
information can hurt, which makes it more intuitive for machine learning
applications. Finally, we apply our framework to probing where we believe
Bayesian mutual information naturally operationalises ease of extraction by
explicitly limiting the available background knowledge to solve a task.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03858">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent works have found evidence of gender bias in models of machine
translation and coreference resolution using mostly synthetic diagnostic
datasets. While these quantify bias in a controlled experiment, they often do
so on a small scale and consist mostly of artificial, out-of-distribution
sentences. In this work, we find grammatical patterns indicating stereotypical
and non-stereotypical gender-role assignments (e.g., female nurses versus male
dancers) in corpora from three domains, resulting in a first large-scale gender
bias dataset of 108K diverse real-world English sentences. We manually verify
the quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various
coreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested
models tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural
inputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems.
Finally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference
resolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set. Our dataset and
models are publicly available at www.github.com/SLAB-NLP/BUG. We hope they will
spur future research into gender bias evaluation mitigation techniques in
realistic settings.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03888">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of
NLP tasks including summarization. Training and inference using large
transformer models can be computationally expensive. Previous work has focused
on one important bottleneck, the quadratic self-attention mechanism in the
encoder. Modified encoder architectures such as LED or LoBART use local
attention patterns to address this problem for summarization. In contrast, this
work focuses on the transformer's encoder-decoder attention mechanism. The cost
of this attention becomes more significant in inference or training approaches
that require model-generated histories. First, we examine the complexity of the
encoder-decoder attention. We demonstrate empirically that there is a sparse
sentence structure in document summarization that can be exploited by
constraining the attention mechanism to a subset of input sentences, whilst
maintaining system performance. Second, we propose a modified architecture that
selects the subset of sentences to constrain the encoder-decoder attention.
Experiments are carried out on abstractive summarization tasks, including
CNN/DailyMail, XSum, Spotify Podcast, and arXiv.

<span><p>We introduce ELIT, the Emory Language and Information Toolkit, which is a
comprehensive NLP framework providing transformer-based end-to-end models for
core tasks with a special focus on memory efficiency while maintaining
state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. Compared to existing toolkits, ELIT
features an efficient Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model with many downstream
tasks that include lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity
recognition, dependency parsing, constituency parsing, semantic role labeling,
and AMR parsing. The backbone of ELIT's MTL framework is a pre-trained
transformer encoder that is shared across tasks to speed up their inference.
ELIT provides pre-trained models developed on a remix of eight datasets. To
scale up its service, ELIT also integrates a RESTful Client/Server combination.
On the server side, ELIT extends its functionality to cover other tasks such as
tokenization and coreference resolution, providing an end user with agile
research experience. All resources including the source codes, documentation,

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Representation of linguistic phenomena in computational language models is
typically assessed against the predictions of existing linguistic theories of
these phenomena. Using the notion of polarity as a case study, we show that
this is not always the most adequate set-up. We probe polarity via so-called
'negative polarity items' (in particular, English 'any') in two pre-trained
Transformer-based models (BERT and GPT-2). We show that -- at least for
polarity -- metrics derived from language models are more consistent with data
from psycholinguistic experiments than linguistic theory predictions.
Establishing this allows us to more adequately evaluate the performance of
language models and also to use language models to discover new insights into
natural language grammar beyond existing linguistic theories. Overall, our
results encourage a closer tie between experiments with human subjects and with
language models. We propose methods to enable this closer tie, with language

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>While recent research on natural language inference has considerably
benefited from large annotated datasets, the amount of inference-related
knowledge (including commonsense) provided in the annotated data is still
rather limited. There have been two lines of approaches that can be used to
further address the limitation: (1) unsupervised pretraining can leverage
knowledge in much larger unstructured text data; (2) structured (often
human-curated) knowledge has started to be considered in neural-network-based
models for NLI. An immediate question is whether these two approaches
complement each other, or how to develop models that can bring together their
advantages. In this paper, we propose models that leverage structured knowledge
in different components of pre-trained models. Our results show that the
proposed models perform better than previous BERT-based state-of-the-art

<span><p>Transformers have recently become very popular for sequence-to-sequence
applications such as machine translation and speech recognition. In this work,
we propose a multi-task learning-based transformer model for low-resource
multilingual speech recognition for Indian languages. Our proposed model
consists of a conformer [1] encoder and two parallel transformer decoders. We
use a phoneme decoder (PHN-DEC) for the phoneme recognition task and a grapheme
decoder (GRP-DEC) to predict grapheme sequence. We consider the phoneme
recognition task as an auxiliary task for our multi-task learning framework. We
jointly optimize the network for both phoneme and grapheme recognition tasks
using Joint CTC-Attention [2] training. We use a conditional decoding scheme to
inject the language information into the model before predicting the grapheme
sequence. Our experiments show that our proposed approach can obtain
significant improvement over previous approaches [4]. We also show that our
conformer-based dual-decoder approach outperforms both the transformer-based
dual-decoder approach and single decoder approach. Finally, We compare

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Currently, multilingual machine translation is receiving more and more
attention since it brings better performance for low resource languages (LRLs)
and saves more space. However, existing multilingual machine translation models
face a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of
different languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We
argue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning
competencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the
learning competencies of different languages and propose Competence-based
Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation, named CCL-M.
Specifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high
resource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) Self-evaluated
Competence, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2)
HRLs-evaluated Competence, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned
according to HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence. Based on the above competencies,
we utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the
training set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel
competenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting
training samples in multilingual training. Experimental results show that our
approach has achieved a steady and significant performance gain compared to the
previous state-of-the-art approach on the TED talks dataset.

generation can circumvent the labor-intensity curation, further accelerating
scientific discovery. Unfortunately, the lack of large-scale terminology

paper, we present a large-scale terminology definition dataset Graphine
covering 2,010,648 terminology definition pairs, spanning 227 biomedical
subdisciplines. Terminologies in each subdiscipline further form a directed
acyclic graph, opening up new avenues for developing graph-aware text

model Graphex that integrates transformer with graph neural network. Our model
outperforms existing text generation models by exploiting the graph structure
of terminologies. We further demonstrated how Graphine can be used to evaluate
pretrained language models, compare graph representation learning methods and
predict sentence granularity. We envision Graphine to be a unique resource for
definition generation and many other NLP tasks in biomedicine.

\textit{separately} pursued under two paradigms: task-oriented dialogue (TOD)
systems, which perform goal-oriented functions, and open-domain dialogue (ODD)
systems, which focus on non-goal-oriented chitchat. The two dialogue modes can
potentially be intertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as
easily done by a friendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in
conversational agents, as the integration makes them more accessible and
useful. Our paper addresses this problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn
dialogues. Based on the popular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset
FusedChat, by rewriting the existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This
procedure constructs conversation sessions containing exchanges from both
dialogue modes. It features inter-mode contextual dependency, i.e., the
dialogue turns from the two modes depend on each other. Rich dependency
patterns including co-reference and ellipsis are features. The new dataset,
with 60k new human-written ODD turns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a
benchmark to test a dialogue model's ability to perform inter-mode
conversations. This is a more challenging task since the model has to determine
the appropriate dialogue mode and generate the response based on the inter-mode
context. But such models would better mimic human-level conversation
capabilities. We evaluate baseline models on this task, including

significantly less present in the zero-shot evaluation of the prompt-based

rich in information. However, more than 20% of relational tables on the web
have 20 or more rows (Cafarella et al., 2008), and these large tables present a
challenge for current Transformer models, which are typically limited to 512
tokens. Here we propose MATE, a novel Transformer architecture designed to
model the structure of web tables. MATE uses sparse attention in a way that
allows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table. This
architecture scales linearly with respect to speed and memory, and can handle
documents containing more than 8000 tokens with current accelerators. MATE also
has a more appropriate inductive bias for tabular data, and sets a new
state-of-the-art for three table reasoning datasets. For HybridQA (Chen et al.,
2020b), a dataset that involves large documents containing tables, we improve
the best prior result by 19 points.

<span><p>Recently, two approaches, fine-tuning large pre-trained language models and
variational training, have attracted significant interests, separately, for
semi-supervised end-to-end task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems. In this paper,
we propose Variational Latent-State GPT model (VLS-GPT), which is the first to
combine the strengths of the two approaches. Among many options of models, we
propose the generative model and the inference model for variational learning
of the end-to-end TOD system, both as auto-regressive language models based on
GPT-2, which can be further trained over a mix of labeled and unlabeled dialog
data in a semi-supervised manner. We develop the strategy of
sampling-then-forward-computation, which successfully overcomes the memory
explosion issue of using GPT in variational learning and speeds up training.
Semi-supervised TOD experiments are conducted on two benchmark multi-domain
datasets of different languages - MultiWOZ2.1 and CrossWOZ. VLS-GPT is shown to
significantly outperform both supervised-only and semi-supervised baselines.

<span><p>Contrastive learning has been gradually applied to learn high-quality
unsupervised sentence embedding. Among the previous un-supervised methods, the
latest state-of-the-art method, as far as we know, is unsupervised SimCSE
(unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE uses the InfoNCE1loss function in the training
stage by pulling semantically similar sentences together and pushing apart
dis-similar ones.Theoretically, we expect to use larger batches in unsup-SimCSE
to get more adequate comparisons among samples and avoid overfitting. However,
increasing the batch size does not always lead to improvements, but instead
even lead to performance degradation when the batch size exceeds a threshold.
Through statistical observation, we find that this is probably due to the
introduction of low-confidence negative pairs after in-creasing the batch size.
To alleviate this problem, we introduce a simple smoothing strategy upon the
InfoNCE loss function, termedGaussian Smoothing InfoNCE
(GS-InfoNCE).Specifically, we add random Gaussian noise vectors as negative
samples, which act asa smoothing of the negative sample space.Though being
simple, the proposed smooth-ing strategy brings substantial improvements to
unsup-SimCSE. We evaluate GS-InfoNCEon the standard semantic text similarity
(STS)task. GS-InfoNCE outperforms the state-of-the-art unsup-SimCSE by an
average Spear-man correlation of 1.38%, 0.72%, 1.17% and0.28% on the base of

large (320 on average), making summarization - and especially training a

reflected in the human-written summaries, and, thus, the summarizer trained on
random review subsets hallucinates. In order to deal with both of these
challenges, we formulate the task as jointly learning to select informative
subsets of reviews and summarizing the opinions expressed in these subsets. The
choice of the review subset is treated as a latent variable, predicted by a
small and simple selector. The subset is then fed into a more powerful
summarizer. For joint training, we use amortized variational inference and

<span><p>Prompts for pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable
performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various
downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and
only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for
adapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to
be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning
performs comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream
data are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning
settings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning in practice. We
attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts.
Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts
into the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this
Pre-trained Prompt Tuning framework "PPT". To ensure the generalization of PPT,
we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and
pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that

complex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take
uncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions
and less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often
evaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream
policy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in
neural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of
policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to
the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with

existing works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a
single granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or

Additionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only
output labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments

a minimal data augmentation method, and passes the same input sentence to a
pre-trained Transformer encoder (with dropout turned on) twice to obtain the
two corresponding embeddings to build a positive pair. As the length
information of a sentence will generally be encoded into the sentence
embeddings due to the usage of position embedding in Transformer, each positive
pair in unsup-SimCSE actually contains the same length information. And thus
unsup-SimCSE trained with these positive pairs is probably biased, which would
tend to consider that sentences of the same or similar length are more similar
in semantics. Through statistical observations, we find that unsup-SimCSE does
have such a problem. To alleviate it, we apply a simple repetition operation to
modify the input sentence, and then pass the input sentence and its modified
counterpart to the pre-trained Transformer encoder, respectively, to get the
positive pair. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the community of computer

the question of whether valid attacks are actually feasible. In this work, we
investigate this through the lens of human language ability. We report on
crowdsourcing studies in which we task humans with iteratively modifying words
in an input text, while receiving immediate model feedback, with the aim of
causing a sentiment classification model to misclassify the example. Our

adversarial examples using semantics-preserving word substitutions. We analyze
how human-generated adversarial examples compare to the recently proposed
TextFooler, Genetic, BAE and SememePSO attack algorithms on the dimensions
naturalness, preservation of sentiment, grammaticality and substitution rate.

such training data can be infeasible because of the labeling cost, task
characteristics, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes an alternative
solution that uses only task-independent word embeddings of high-resource
languages and bilingual dictionaries. First, we construct a dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the
possibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The
remaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are
considered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the
heterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and
language-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.
Furthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many

predicting whether a source token needs to be translated or transliterated to
the target language, which is common in cross-script translation tasks (i.e.,
where source and target do not share the written script). For such cases, we
propose training the model with additional hints (as target tags on the

<span><p>Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language
processing (NLP) research. Many existing state-of-the-art models are first
pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks.
However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely
large capacity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the
adapted model to overfit the data of downstream tasks and forget the knowledge
of the pre-trained model. To address the above issue in a more principled
manner, we propose a new computational framework for robust and efficient
fine-tuning for pre-trained language models. Specifically, our proposed
framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing
regularization, which effectively manages the capacity of the model; 2. Bregman
proximal point optimization, which is a class of trust-region methods and can
prevent knowledge forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP benchmarks.

recurrent neural networks utilize their memory as counters. Thus, one potential
way to understand the success of these networks is to revisit the theory of
counter computation. Therefore, we study the abilities of real-time counter
machines as formal grammars, focusing on formal properties that are relevant
for NLP models. We first show that several variants of the counter machine
converge to express the same class of formal languages. We also prove that
counter languages are closed under complement, union, intersection, and many
other common set operations. Next, we show that counter machines cannot
evaluate boolean expressions, even though they can weakly validate their
syntax. This has implications for the interpretability and evaluation of neural
network systems: successfully matching syntactic patterns does not guarantee
that counter memory accurately encodes compositional semantics. Finally, we
consider whether counter languages are semilinear. This work makes general
contributions to the theory of formal languages that are of potential interest

Specifically, we decompose decoding into two phases where an input utterance is

<span><p>When trained on large, unfiltered crawls from the internet, language models
pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the

As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good
performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to
such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding:
pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their
undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to
this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a
decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired
behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic

on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or

The retrieval model is typically trained to maximize the likelihood of the

evidence candidates. Moreover, not all such candidates are labeled as positive

KnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and

ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method,
changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a
consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this

<span><p>In this work, we introduce back-training, an alternative to self-training for
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from source to target domain. While
self-training generates synthetic training data where natural inputs are
aligned with noisy outputs, back-training results in natural outputs aligned
with noisy inputs. This significantly reduces the gap between the target domain
and synthetic data distribution, and reduces model overfitting to the source
domain. We run UDA experiments on question generation and passage retrieval
from the \textit{Natural Questions} domain to machine learning and biomedical
domains. We find that back-training vastly outperforms self-training by a mean
improvement of 7.8 BLEU-4 points on generation, and 17.6\% top-20 retrieval
accuracy across both domains. We further propose consistency filters to remove
low-quality synthetic data before training. We also release a new
domain-adaptation dataset- \textit{MLQuestions} containing 35K unaligned
questions, 50K unaligned passages, and 3K aligned question-passage pairs.

Our method trains additional prediction heads on top of intermediate layers,

<span><p>An interpretable system for open-domain reasoning needs to express its
reasoning process in a transparent form. Natural language is an attractive
representation for this purpose -- it is both highly expressive and easy for
humans to understand. However, manipulating natural language statements in
logically consistent ways is hard: models must cope with variation in how
meaning is expressed while remaining precise. In this paper, we describe
ParaPattern, a method for building models to generate deductive inferences from
diverse natural language inputs without direct human supervision. We train
BART-based models (Lewis et al., 2020) to generate the result of applying a
particular logical operation to one or more premise statements. Crucially, we
develop a largely automated pipeline for constructing suitable training
examples from Wikipedia. We evaluate our models using out-of-domain sentence
compositions from the QASC (Khot et al., 2020) and EntailmentBank (Dalvi et
al., 2021) datasets as well as targeted perturbation sets. Our results show
that our models are substantially more accurate and flexible than baseline
systems. ParaPattern achieves 85% validity on examples of the 'substitution'
operation from EntailmentBank without the use of any in-domain training data,
matching the performance of a model fine-tuned for EntailmentBank. The full

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Code representation learning, which aims to encode the semantics of source
code into distributed vectors, plays an important role in recent
deep-learning-based models for code intelligence. Recently, many pre-trained
language models for source code (e.g., CuBERT and CodeBERT) have been proposed
to model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code
intelligence tasks such as code search, code clone detection, and program
translation. Current approaches typically consider the source code as a plain
sequence of tokens, or inject the structure information (e.g., AST and
data-flow) into the sequential model pre-training. To further explore the
properties of programming languages, this paper proposes SynCoBERT, a
syntax-guided multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach for better code
representations. Specially, we design two novel pre-training objectives
originating from the symbolic and syntactic properties of source code, i.e.,
Identifier Prediction (IP) and AST Edge Prediction (TEP), which are designed to
predict identifiers, and edges between two nodes of AST, respectively.
Meanwhile, to exploit the complementary information in semantically equivalent
modalities (i.e., code, comment, AST) of the code, we propose a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to maximize the mutual information among
different modalities. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks related to
code intelligence show that SynCoBERT advances the state-of-the-art with the
same pre-training corpus and model size.

<span><p>In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those
that come first. Or they encode entity features and relation features in a
parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work has claimed, our auxiliary experiments suggest that
relation prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a
non-negligible way. The source code can be found at

<span><p>Extractive text summarization aims at extracting the most representative
sentences from a given document as its summary. To extract a good summary from
a long text document, sentence embedding plays an important role. Recent
studies have leveraged graph neural networks to capture the inter-sentential

embedding. However, those approaches neither consider multiple types of
inter-sentential relationships (e.g., semantic similarity &amp; natural

<span><p>Most existing NER methods rely on extensive labeled data for model training,
which struggles in the low-resource scenarios with limited training data.
Recently, prompt-tuning methods for pre-trained language models have achieved
remarkable performance in few-shot learning by exploiting prompts as task
guidance to reduce the gap between training progress and downstream tuning.
Inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel lightweight generative
framework with prompt-guided attention for low-resource NER (LightNER).
Specifically, we construct the semantic-aware answer space of entity categories
for prompt learning to generate the entity span sequence and entity categories
without any label-specific classifiers. We further propose prompt-guided
attention by incorporating continuous prompts into the self-attention layer to
re-modulate the attention and adapt pre-trained weights. Note that we only tune
those continuous prompts with the whole parameter of the pre-trained language
model fixed, thus, making our approach lightweight and flexible for
low-resource scenarios and can better transfer knowledge across domains.
Experimental results show that LightNER can obtain comparable performance in
the standard supervised setting and outperform strong baselines in low-resource
settings by tuning only a small part of the parameters.

<span><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis is a trending area of research, and the
multimodal fusion is one of its most active topic. Acknowledging humans
communicate through a variety of channels (i.e visual, acoustic, linguistic),
multimodal systems aim at integrating different unimodal representations into a
synthetic one. So far, a consequent effort has been made on developing complex
architectures allowing the fusion of these modalities. However, such systems
are mainly trained by minimising simple losses such as $L_1$ or cross-entropy.
In this work, we investigate unexplored penalties and propose a set of new
objectives that measure the dependency between modalities. We demonstrate that
our new penalties lead to a consistent improvement (up to $4.3$ on accuracy)
across a large variety of state-of-the-art models on two well-known sentiment
